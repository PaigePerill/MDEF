# Design Studio Term 2

Assignment: Reflect on your and your project’s current stage of development allowing
your project to talk back. Analyze your so-called “failures” as opportunities for
redefining your frames of reference and repositioning yourself and your project
accordingly.

d. Deliverable: An updated version of your design space. A 500 word text with a
summary of your journey so far, adding the repositioning of yourself and your project.
Make explicit new project goals and next steps including a proposal for the 1st
intervention of the second trimester (a draft will be discussed during the design
reviews the week after).
