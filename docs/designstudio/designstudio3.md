^^Assignment:A proposal for the first intervention of the term based on the alternative present created^^

For this assigment I'll be describing the intervention we're preparing for the Interspecies Tarot.

While we're still working on evolving the deck, we are slowly creating a few draft cards with illustrations and descriptions. 
By June, we will have enough to share with a croud of bioenthusiasts, bioartists and biohackers to gather around a collective reading. 
Each participant will bring a question related to another species they have been having in their research.  One by one, and one after the other, each participant will pull three cards. For each pull, The facilitator/tarot reader (likely me) will then propose a preliminary reading based on the information in the booklet and then encourage the crowd to offer their visions, alternative reading and collectively discuss the research questions in light of the symbology in the cards and their personal/collective unconscious.



^^Assigment: Update your alternative present including a description of the roles you would like to have in it^^

Current Present: For millenia humans have been farming, domesticating, breeding and testing on animals. But until we can successfully communicate, we evolve in ethical murky waters, and continue our interactions with other species in a way that may be harmful.

Alternative Present: There is now a tarot dech that helps us ask ourselves a wholesome set of questions and guides us towards more in alignment with other species 

To evolve this Tarot deck, Carolina will be working on the research of the concepts we've chosen to present (concepts in biology, philosophy and indigenous knowledge), Angel will illustrate the cards, and I will write the tarology descrptions/interpretations for the attached booklet - ie the storytellling.
