# February 23rd 2023 : Networking


**Reflection**

The class what about understanding "What is a network?"

in Electronics, networking is about creating copies of information so that we can receive what others have and communicate with one another.

 Throughout history, we have developed networks to move information from one place to another by creating parallel copies. We talked about about how information moves, bounces and can even be encrypted, by making frequent leaps. We discussed topics such as undersea optic cables, the energy consumption of these leaps, the significance of networks in history and how they are linked to current forms of communication. 
 
 
For the excercise I was at the table with Ramiro. We initially connected our ESP32 feather boards to the local Wi-Fi network to send our own messages.

We then accessed Victor's IP address as our local server to receive his message. After each individual connected to the local server, we could communicate with one another.

This exercise demonstrated how sending and receiving messages can be complicated, but on a smaller scale, you can pinpoint where your information is stored directly. You have control over your data and can choose to keep or delete it, rather than relying on cloud storage. Storing information locally is beneficial as it allows you to manage your data more efficiently and keep only what is necessary. The three images below depict the three stages of our exercise: connecting to the network, accessing the local server, and communicating with each other locally.
