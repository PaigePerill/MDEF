# February 23rd 2023 : Networking


**Reflection**

The class what about understanding "What is a network?"

in Electronics, networking is about creating copies of information so that we can receive what others have and communicate with one another.

 Throughout history, we have developed networks to move information from one place to another by creating parallel copies. We talked about about how information moves, bounces and can even be encrypted, by making frequent leaps. We discussed topics such as undersea optic cables, the energy consumption of these leaps, the significance of networks in history and how they are linked to current forms of communication.
