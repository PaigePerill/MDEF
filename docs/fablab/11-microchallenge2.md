# March

The results of Microchallenge 2 are reflected in the following repository: https://github.com/PaigePerill/InterspeciesTarot


**Reflection**

For this microchallenge I was allowed to work on my own so I could craft an object for the design dialogues. Since Carolina and I are working on a project called "the Interspecies Tarot" - but we have months of work before the content really exists in any sort of quality, we decided to create a box that would announce the concept. 

It was straightforward to ideate the concept since there was no one to debate and align with and I agreed with most of the suggestions from the fab lab team. The most interesting was that I still absolutely don't feel confident in electronics or coding and I felt resistance to any of the ideas that were trying to push my project further since it did not feel like I had the time or capacity to carry them forward. 

I am also thankful to many of classmates who helped me create the files I needed and teach me bits and pieces of 3D modelling almost every week. I cannot say I have had the time to become confident in this either but every project helps me grasp it further.
