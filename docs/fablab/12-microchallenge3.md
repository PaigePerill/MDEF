# May

For this Microchallenge, Dhriti and I colaborated on creating a spreadsheet that gathered the data for all the past microchallenges of MDEF. 

**Reflection**

The is something oddly satisfying about filling a spreadheet once you get into the zone. Going through all the past challenges of MDEF students was interesting. Seeing the logic of past fab-lab classes and how students applied their learning in diverse groups helped me find meaning in my experience. I look forward to seeing what data flows and connection the spreasheet uncovers in a data visualisation.
