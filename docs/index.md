I explore the intersection of design, art and technology to uncover how we can design as ecologies, rather than as individuals.

With a background in geography and open innovation, I often work as part of interdisciplinary teams setting a a vision and guiding projects from idea to execution. Coordinating and storytelling so the tale told is accessible and impactful.
