# Bootcamp

Towards Organica is a narrative in development. As we go about our daily lives, most of the information we capture about the future shows disastrous fact; it shapes a storytelling that is ultimately crippling us. By emerging an optimistic balance point in our future, this narrative hopes to define a human/non-human equilibrium to aspire to. I use storytelling to shape my work {my fight} so as to create an embodied idea of the nebulous instincts that pull me; but also to communicate outwards and invite others on an adventure straddling the practical and speculative.

The imagery included in the poster shows famous biodesign projects and tools, from Neri Oxman’s Aguahoja to more obscure Star Trek references (the Bio-ship from Species 8472: literally an extension of the extraterrestrials’s bodies), all mythic experiments in storytelling.
