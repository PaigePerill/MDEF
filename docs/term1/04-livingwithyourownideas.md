# October 31st to November 4th 2022 : Living with Your Own Ideas

<br>

The Living with Your own ideas week is about exploring a concept without the need of a finalized prototype. Even more, it's about involving yourself in the process of speculating the future by embodying the idea. What's required here is to sit in the in between, before the concept fully materializes. 

The goal is to think through doing, and importantly, understand the design process as a situated action.   Use Yourself as a design research instrument. Taking a first person perspective (also called  autobiographical design, embodied ideation methods, autoethnography) allows you to immerse yourself personally in the concept, and get an experiencial perspective of you project and its socio-techno implications. The process of testing/prototyping on self and ^^living with^^ allows you to, over a long period of time, uncover new assumptions and grasp an emotionality about technology that you can’t get from simply brainstorming.

It can be useful when thinking about new technologies to protype “quick & dirty” over time to dig out all of the impacts and consequences of this same tech + the visceral knowledge tied to it.
