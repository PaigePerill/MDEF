# January 24th and March 13th 2023 : Communicating Ideas


Byt Kate Armstrong 

You’re only as radical as you are accessible.

Humans - giving meaning to meaningless things. Our responsibility as designer to give our innovations meaning - we are responsible for designing the object but also the intangible meaning that goes with it + to make it accessible. 



^^Assignment: Assemble your personnal brand kit.^^


1.

Purpose : Work in the hybrid space between design, science and art to explore how we can design as ecologies, rather than for individuals. 

Vision: Comitted to for a world where human impact on the biosphere is intentional and supportive of the ecologies we belong to. 

Mission Statement: Work on projects that decenter the human and put us back into our larger contexts. 


**2.Personal Brand kit :** 

- Something that represents you: Rock from the desert
- Fonts  ( Diatype Medium + Monument Grotek Mono Regular)
- Colours (Black, White and Earth Tones (Soil Brown, Tree Green and River Blue)
- Values  (Divergent, Laconic, Empathetic)

**3. Minimum Viable Message about your intervention/ research.** 

**The Interspecies Tarot** is a wholesome set of questions for practionners to work (as much as possible) in alignment with other species . 

**The Altered States XXX** is a process for managing transformation towards non-human states. 

**Future Cravings** is an interdisciplinary dinning experience where the tableware and cuisine are made of the same ingredients ~~with a special focus on food waste and biodesigned species.~~ They focus on specific subject reflected in the dinner’s materiality which provokes divergent insight. 

This a new methodology for climate action, based on the original problem solving forum: the dinner table. 

**Electric Skin** is a new, self powering material. It generate electricity from the humidity in the air.

Our vision is of a radically sustainable energy future, where our power generation and our electronics are growable and compostable. Where our electronic devices have a new materiality, complex, textured, and perhaps even alive.
