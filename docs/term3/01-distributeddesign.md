**Reflection**

^^Learning Skills: Which skills did I need during the activity and how can I translate into something useful for me and my future?^^
We did this exercise on Chat GPT so I activated my previous knowledge about machine learning and AI + data storage.



^^Dynamics: How was the dynamic inside the group?^^
The dynamic was Collaborative, sharing, playful, ping-pong like, riffing... 


^^Interactions: Did the role I played influence my opinion?^^
I didnâ€™t feel like I had any particular role. More a passenger playing along in a game. Without a personal subject to apply it to, it was difficult to be very engaged. It also reminded me of future proofing methodologies.

The reflection tree was interesting as an exercise to do at the beginning stage of the project. I needed to draw on my past experiences in other projects to imagine what might happen in the one I chose to apply to Rflection Tree to (the Interspecies Tarot)

^^Dynamics: How was the dynamic inside the group?^^
We helped each other answer questions on our respective project and challenged some of the content in the reflection tree. 

^^Interactions: Did the role I played influence my opinion?^^
As a user, and as someone who has gone through many workshops such as this one, it was interesting to critique the flow and content of the activity.

This one was about playful debate and lateral thinking. Using other methods of brainstorming (coffee painting) to draw out insights about the meaning of curiosity. 

^^Dynamics: How was the dynamic inside the group?^^
Playful, engaged, ready to debate and challenge each other as well as be vulnerable; 

^^Interactions: Did the role I played influence my opinion?^^
I had put out the "Curiosity" value, but my classmates exitedly took it to heart and gave their opinions. I learned a lot from them.
