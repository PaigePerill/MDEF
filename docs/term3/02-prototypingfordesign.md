# April 19th & 20th 2023 : Prototyping for Design 

**Reflection**

These classes were focused on Robotic Arms and Blender. 

While I could not attend the robotic arm class I caught up with the help of my classmates. 
It is fascinating how pervasive robots are in our lives, and even more so at IAAC. It was interesting to think about the basic functioning of a robotic arm and how many axes (6) it has to function. This means a tremendous amount of precision and possibility of movement, and the opportunity to create complex assembly lines that build anything from our assembly lines to our yoghurts. 



The Blender class was interesting. While I still have not managed to find deep interest in CAM or truly develop my skills in this area, Victor is a great and passionate teacher and openined our eyes to the Blender ecosystem as well as its values. It is crazy to me how profoundly a tool can be developed with the impetus of a few passionate people and a supportive community. 
We did try and follow Victor to execute a few operations on Blender, though many of us struggled due to various software issues. Some of my classmate did manage to operate the led strip. 


The last class of this seminar involved live coding. This was also fasccinating to me, because although I don't connect to this practice, I could see the existence of a whole community of practice, gathering common excercices and sharing skills purely for art's sake. In the classes we learned that coders sometimes invent their own languages and interfaces as is the case with Hydra. it was fun to experiment with the software and be guided through it, though this is not my world and I likely won't interact with this much further.
