# May 2nd & 9th 2023 : Critical Transfeminist Design 

**Reflection**

This week we had classes with Laura Benitez Valero. We adressed alternative worlds of design exploring projects in bio hacking and queer practices- 

This is a world I have been exposed to for a while. Biodesign as a field of inquiry is deeply interested in these questions of human ethics vs non-human ethics. What is human, post-human etc. What are the limits of our bodies and what does morality have to do with it? How can other species be examples of others ways of being. How can other species be alternative models of gender, transformation and crucially design? 


It was wonderful to be reminded of Lynn Margulisâ€™s work in challenging the survival of the fittest narrative but also hear of other profound thinkers in care ethics. 

All of the projects that I work on grapple with the questions and this class gave me more tools to dig in to and make even more informed design.
