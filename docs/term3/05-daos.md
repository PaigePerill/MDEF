Limited Edition Tarot card of Umwelt, from the Interspecies Tarot Deck, showing a zebra finch with a subtle glow around its head to highlight its sensitivity to magnetic fields, magnetoreception mechanism, and protein CRY4. The card also includes a small illustration of the Earth's magnetic field and a diagram of how the protein CRY4 works. Art by Mattias Adolfsson, inspired by Ryan Mandell's research.
