Prototyping is a way to generate knowledge. It allows for the combining of expertise from various backgrounds. In that sense, the way we prototype shapes our project. We can divide prototyping into 4 roles. In this section I am exploring how I have used prototyping in my projects, especially my ongoing project Electric Skin . Role 1 - The Prototype as an Experimental Component Role 1 is about testing specific hypotheses. The prototype embeds the theory we\u2019re trying to test. *Case Study 1 I am working on a project called Electric Skin: A new biomaterial that can generate electricity fromm the humidity in the air - and to demonstrate it we\u2019re attempting to create a Wall Light. I used Role 1 to test my colleague Nada \u2019s renders for an our Wall Light prototype in various materials. Our hypotheses was that Chitin would be a good base material for the skin and that our lamp could be built using a clay 3D printer. What did I learn? I had never used 3D printing technologies. I worked with Guillaume Barbareau , a 3D printing expert at his residency space at the Printemps de Septembre and witnessed first hand the complexities of biomaterial 3D printing. I first worked on the chitin paste and assembled the recipe with the help of chef Anton Petrov . This was a challenge. There are a few chitin biomaterial recipes, and even some open research on chitin pastes for 3D printing. However making the paste is not straightforward. The chitin reacts with the calcium and makes it very hard to mix. In the absence of an appropriate blender we had to hand mix, which could only be done with strong arms (not mine). We then tested this paste in the 3D printer (EAZAO make). Our Chitin material\u2019s texture was very sticky so it was hard to insert into the tube and then figuring out the right extrusion speed and pressure were also challenges, well handled by Guillaume. The Chitin tests were inconclusive - the drying process revealed shrinkage problems but the biggest lesson was that perhaps in the Electric Skin project, that was not where we wanted to innovate. Hence we tested Nada\u2019s render with clay (which was what the 3D printer was made for) which gave better results, but still showed us that the intricacies of the design (the wavy surface texture) was difficult to 3D print in the sense that we could not get the extrusion speed right and layers or clay would be peeled off. Voir cette publication sur Instagram Une publication partag\u00e9e par Electric Skin (@electric.skin) Role 2 - The Prototype as a means of Inquiry This involves prototyping to explore something that you don\u2019t know yet. To uncover a theory rather than compare hypotheses. I attended the Future of Life 2022 program in Karlsruhe and participated in the Human-Non-Human workshop track organized and taught by Paula Nerlich and Romy Kaiser of the HBBE and Human Bacteria Interfaces. There we explored working with Non-Humans, with a special focus on microbes (with Electric Skin, I am working with Geobacter sulfurresducens , and I\u2019m interested in deepening my knowledge of this species, and learn how to work well/ethically with it. I was able to use the facilities at HfG Karlsruhe and 3D print our prototype in a bioresin. I wanted to explore how strangers might react to our Wall Light prototype, especially it shape, its texture, and its meaning given a bit context. At the end of the week, during our presentation, I invited the participants to join me in a \u201critual\u201d. More specifically I invited them to imagine they were waking up and performing a morning routine: walking to the light and contemplating their relationship with the non-human through this symbolic object/subject. I then invited them to come close to the prototype and touch the object. I recorded their reactions and talked to the participants about their feelings engaging in this exercise. Many commented on the \u201cgooeyness\u201d of the object, and the strangeness of it. The exploration revealed our chosen form for the prototype was alien. An effect we were hoping to produce (ie offering an alternative materiality to the objects that surround us) however it also showed us that this is the main message people receive. They feel the strangeness of it but forget the more exciting underlying biodesign principle (electricity from the air + biodegradable object). Role 3 - The prototype as a research archetype This role involves using a prototype to physicalise a specific concept, understanding or space. Here rather than waiting till we can prototype everything, then we simply prototype possibilities. Storytelling can be a way to manifest a research archetype - and Sci Fi is a good example of this. *Case Study Daniel Grushkin and Alexandra Kisielewski, the team behind Biodesigned Magazine invited us to write an article on Electric Skin. Because of the format of this publication which invites deeper personal thinking in relation to Biodesign and its possibilities, we wrote an article that allowed us to reflect on the future we wanted to manifest through this innovation. It was an exercise in speculative storytelling, and through this article we physicalised our concept further. In it, we explored the possibility of our electronic devices to become conscious companions that provide much more than their software. We honed in on the idea that the texture of our phones could hold deep symbolism around our ancestry and in their materiality could become a source of connection and relief rather than blandness. We evolved further renders to illustrate the concept and conjured a meditation to illustrate the future texture of electronic symbionts.

The prototyping process here can also be a dialogue with yourself and hence be a method of autobiographical inquiry. *Case Study. As I am going through the Electric Skin Adventure: the process of building a biodesign project, I am discovering the challenges of navigating the biotech industry. I am confronted to issues in accessing labs or even understanding the species I am working with. I am uncovering communities and funding vehicles, as well as other interesting practitioners and organizations in the field. Here, the process is crucial.

A 500 word text with a summary of your journey so far, adding the repositioning of yourself and your project. Make explicit new project goals and next steps including a proposal for the 1 st intervention of the second trimester (a draft will be discussed during the design reviews the week after). Adapted from Thesis Draft: Intervention: Altered States/ AUgmented Creativity for non human collaboration For the collective intervention around the question \u201dHow do we use Altered/Augmented states to design from a non-human perspective ?\u201d We had designed a small intervention in the Motion Capture (MOCAP) room at Elisava. A few in the group are interested in water as the non human entity, so we designed a protocol that hopes to decenter the human and bring them more towards a water state of mind. The protocol consisted of several steps: 1: Set the space: we filled the space with a music elaborated by Endel Sounds, they are rhythms created in collaboration between scientists and musicians to provoke various states of mind - from relaxed, to focused or even sleepy. We also flashed a video of jellyfish on a wall (the MOCAP room is not particularly inviting but we wanted to capture the movement of people through space and see if any useful information came up). Flashing a video helped make the space more inviting and evoke a water visual. 2: Drink tea : We hope this action would connect the human to the sound of water being poured, the fluidity of that experience, and the fact that our body is largely made of water. The tea was also made of relaxing herbs, and specifically designed to relax the body and mind for a smoother easing into the experience. It was served in a ritualistic way, in silence, or with prompts to help people be present to the various sensations of the pouring (inspired by tea ceremony rituals). 3: BreathWork + Movement: We invited participants to take deep breaths, relax in to the space, and then get up and move their body in ways that felt right. For many people this is a difficult exercise. We felt it might help people inhabit the space more, and ease the into the next step of the protocol. 4: Moving along a meaning grid: We had mapped 4 corners of the room with different meanings (Human - Non Human and Fluid - Stagnant) and asked participants to freely move around the room grid whilst listening to a poem that evoked water and it different forms and cycles. This is what we hoped to capture with the MOCAP devices. I was the one facilitating this protocol which was intimidating. It was part of the mistakes we made. Though at this stage we had no other option, I am not a trained facilitator and I did not have the deep confidence to lead others into the experience with perfect timings and flow that trained experts might. I moved too quickly through the various steps and as a result the experience felt short, and some participants were less able to \u201cdecenter\u201d. The other crucial mistake we made was not to ask anything of our participants after. the experience. We asked them to write their feelings, but we should have asked them to design with us around a specific question related to water. The grid was also ultimately not successful as it was too intellectual an exercise and kept participants in their mind rather than in their body which instinctually feels like the better space for non-human relating.

Normal computers have several board that you assemble. The raspberrypi is a single board computer not a microcontroller. They have different things they can do. The RAM is different. You can still use them in similar ways, the only thing that changes is how you interface them, since computers already have an interface: an operating system. An microcontroller you have to give all the instructions. That\u2019s a really big difference. Arduino is kind of a microcontroller, but it\u2019s especially a brand that have many variations. The Feather boards are designed by Adafruit in contrast - they are more compatible with the feather ecosystem. In MDEF we are using the ESP Feather 32 BUT with Arduino.

Basic Principles of Arduino: ****Freedom to use, understand, modify and share your tools.**** Arduino invest a lot into education so even novices can learn the beasics of electronics. They managed to create a community of people who aligh with the same spirit of learning and sharing and spread their knowledge via tutorials for everything and anything; A great body of knowledge has been built around the Arduino ecosystem. Assignment:make some music with your board and a simple buzzer (done with the help of brother and translated back as best possible) Set up the ESP32 Feather board and connect a buzzer to the board\u2019s GPIO pin. Install the necessary software tools, such as the Arduino IDE and the ESP32 board support package. Open the Arduino IDE and create a new sketch. In the sketch, include the necessary libraries for the ESP32 and the buzzer, such as the \u201ctoneMelody\u201d library. Define the pin that the buzzer is connected to by using the \u201ctone\u201d function. Write the melody you want the buzzer to play using the \u201ctone\u201d function. Specify the frequency and duration of each note in the melody. Upload the sketch to the ESP32 Feather board and test the buzzer to make sure it is playing the melody correctly. \u201cHappy Birthday\u201d melody using the ESP32 Feather board and a buzzer: #include \"pitches.h\" // notes in the melody int melody[] = { NOTE_G4, NOTE_G4, NOTE_A4, NOTE_G4, NOTE_C5, NOTE_B4, NOTE_G4, NOTE_G4, NOTE_A4, NOTE_G4, NOTE_D5, NOTE_C5, NOTE_G4, NOTE_G4, NOTE_G5, NOTE_E5, NOTE_C5, NOTE_B4, NOTE_A4, NOTE_F5, NOTE_F5, NOTE_E5, NOTE_C5, NOTE_D5, NOTE_C5 }; // note durations: 4 = quarter note, 8 = eighth note, etc. int noteDurations[] = { 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 2, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 2, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 2, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 2 }; void setup() { // set the buzzer pin as an output pinMode(2, OUTPUT); } void loop() { // iterate over the notes of the melody for (int i = 0; i < sizeof(melody) / sizeof(melody[0]); i++) { int duration = 1000 / noteDurations[i]; tone(2, melody[i], duration); delay(duration * 1.3); // add a pause between notes noTone(2); // stop the tone } } In this code, the \u201cpitches\u201d library provides the frequency values for each note. We define the notes and note durations for the \u201cHappy Birthday\u201d melody, and then iterate over the notes to play them using the \u201ctone\u201d function. It\u2019s also necessary to add a delay between notes to create a pause, and use the \u201cnoTone\u201d function to stop the tone after each note.

They managed to create a community of people who aligh with the same spirit of learning and sharing and spread their knowledge via tutorials for everything and anything; A great body of knowledge has been built around the Arduino ecosystem. Assignment:make some music with your board and a simple buzzer (done with the help of brother and translated back as best possible) Set up the ESP32 Feather board and connect a buzzer to the board\u2019s GPIO pin. Install the necessary software tools, such as the Arduino IDE and the ESP32 board support package. Open the Arduino IDE and create a new sketch. In the sketch, include the necessary libraries for the ESP32 and the buzzer, such as the \u201ctoneMelody\u201d library. Define the pin that the buzzer is connected to by using the \u201ctone\u201d function. Write the melody you want the buzzer to play using the \u201ctone\u201d function. Specify the frequency and duration of each note in the melody. Upload the sketch to the ESP32 Feather board and test the buzzer to make sure it is playing the melody correctly. \u201cHappy Birthday\u201d melody using the ESP32 Feather board and a buzzer: #include \"pitches.h\" // notes in the melody int melody[] = { NOTE_G4, NOTE_G4, NOTE_A4, NOTE_G4, NOTE_C5, NOTE_B4, NOTE_G4, NOTE_G4, NOTE_A4, NOTE_G4, NOTE_D5, NOTE_C5, NOTE_G4, NOTE_G4, NOTE_G5, NOTE_E5, NOTE_C5, NOTE_B4, NOTE_A4, NOTE_F5, NOTE_F5, NOTE_E5, NOTE_C5, NOTE_D5, NOTE_C5 }; // note durations: 4 = quarter note, 8 = eighth note, etc. int noteDurations[] = { 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 2, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 2, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 2, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 2 }; void setup() { // set the buzzer pin as an output pinMode(2, OUTPUT); } void loop() { // iterate over the notes of the melody for (int i = 0; i < sizeof(melody) / sizeof(melody[0]); i++) { int duration = 1000 / noteDurations[i]; tone(2, melody[i], duration); delay(duration * 1.3); // add a pause between notes noTone(2); // stop the tone } } In this code, the \u201cpitches\u201d library provides the frequency values for each note. We define the notes and note durations for the \u201cHappy Birthday\u201d melody, and then iterate over the notes to play them using the \u201ctone\u201d function. It\u2019s also necessary to add a delay between notes to create a pause, and use the \u201cnoTone\u201d function to stop the tone after each note. Finally, upload the code to the ESP32 Feather board and the buzzer plays the melody.","title":"February 1st 2023 : Electronics and Coding"},{"location":"fablab/02-designandprototyping/","text":"February 2 nd 2023 : Design and Prototyping \u00b6 Reflection The Basics: This class was about understand the various softwares and newer trends but also chosing which software is best for us.

This differs from subtractive manufacturing methods like CNC. One example of 3D printing is Fused Deposition Modelling (FDM), which extrudes thermoplastic material in thin lines to create objects. Materials such as Pla, Abs, Nylon, Petg, Tpu-filaflex and hips can be used in FDM printing. Another technique is Stereolithography (SLA), which is the oldest patented additive manufacturing process that builds a workpiece layer by layer using freely materializing points in space. No support is needed for SLA printing, unlike FDM. For metal parts, there is a technique called \u201c3DP\u201d, which uses lasers to sint thin layers of powdered material, and can print in liquids like resins or in the air. Programs like Ultimaker and Netfab Autocad can be used to create slices of the 3D file for printing. The thinner the slices, the more accurate the printing will be, but the longer it will take. The shell thickness and filling density can also be adjusted. Different shapes of fillings, such as rectangular, triangular, wiggle or honeycomb, can be used. Photogrammetry is a tool that can be used to scan pictures to create 3D models for printing, while 3D shapes can be scanned using a laser like \u201cLidar 3d scanning\u201d to create accurate models of objects, rooms, and buildings.

CNC machines available can have three axes or more. These machines are generally heavy and use coolant liquids for heat reduction. CNC machines have two types of motors - a router motor (less expensive) and a spindle motor (quieter, with more power). To prevent material from breaking while milling, a lubricating substance is necessary, which can either be applied manually (less expensive, cleaner, and weaker) or automatically (costly, dirty, and powerful). Milling requires special attention to aspects such as the kerf tolerance and material \u201cbounce back.\u201d Additionally, sharp edges are not achievable at the end of the milling process; instead, the edges are rounded or require a t-bone or dog bone shape to ensure support in the middle. To fabricate with CNC, one must first create a 3D model and then export it to a g-code while adjusting the machine and material settings. Two different bits can be used for CNC machines, mills for milling (flat), and drills for creating holes (round). Moreover, there are different types of rotations such as straight, up, down, and compression. The chip load, which refers to the amount of material removed by each cutting tool revolution, must also be set up before milling. Milling can be done from either the top or the bottom for better accuracy, and attachments such as vacuum, T-slot, double-sided tape, screws, or taps can be used to ensure accuracy. I did the CNC Homework as part of my Microchallenge week. Below is the process I followed: InterspeciesTarot \u00b6 Boxset Making Instructions This documentation describes the making of a box for holding a deck of cards and a booklet. When the box opens, a Voice will describe the context of the object and why it needs to exist. The deck of cards and booklet are tied to my Project with Carolina called the Interpecies Tarot. It is a tarot deck that illustrates and poses the crucial questions we need to ask ourselves when working with other species to act more in alignment. By using the tarot format, we can go into detail about each concept card in the booklet, while the cards remain evocative images. This works well for the project because we can expand on complex subjects in written form including a mix of scientific concepts, poetic storytelling and references, yet stay engaging and playful. Because the content is not entirely ready yet, the voice recording part of this project (which was Daphne\u2019s idea) is a good addition, since it can be a placeholder until the content is ready (cards+booklet), yet still intrigue and inspire the audience. The inspiration for the booklet is the Dali Tarot Boxset: Step 1: Define how the box will be made. I had orginally thought of laser cutting various pieces of plywood with the lasercutter and assembling them together, however Eduardo suggested I instead CNC the slots shapes into a large block of wood. We went to see the available wood in the scrap pile and found a thick piece of white oak wood that fit the brief perfectly. Step 2: Sketch the file and get feedback.

Step 6: Eduardo double checked the files and for the last part of the operation which is cutting out the final piece of wood from the larger block, he suggested we use a longer drill bit for the last operation (cuting out the rectangle our of the larger piece of wood) since drilled bits cannot go down more than half their lenght.

Step 8 : Launch job. There were 3 seperate jobs. The first one was the back side with the slot for electronics. The second one was the front side with the slots for the booklet, the cars and the microphone.

CNC machines available can have three axes or more. These machines are generally heavy and use coolant liquids for heat reduction. CNC machines have two types of motors - a router motor (less expensive) and a spindle motor (quieter, with more power). To prevent material from breaking while milling, a lubricating substance is necessary, which can either be applied manually (less expensive, cleaner, and weaker) or automatically (costly, dirty, and powerful). Milling requires special attention to aspects such as the kerf tolerance and material \u201cbounce back.\u201d Additionally, sharp edges are not achievable at the end of the milling process; instead, the edges are rounded or require a t-bone or dog bone shape to ensure support in the middle. To fabricate with CNC, one must first create a 3D model and then export it to a g-code while adjusting the machine and material settings. Two different bits can be used for CNC machines, mills for milling (flat), and drills for creating holes (round). Moreover, there are different types of rotations such as straight, up, down, and compression. The chip load, which refers to the amount of material removed by each cutting tool revolution, must also be set up before milling. Milling can be done from either the top or the bottom for better accuracy, and attachments such as vacuum, T-slot, double-sided tape, screws, or taps can be used to ensure accuracy. I did the CNC Homework as part of my Microchallenge week. Below is the process I followed:","title":"February March 1st 2023 : CNC"},{"location":"fablab/09-cnc/#interspeciestarot","text":"Boxset Making Instructions This documentation describes the making of a box for holding a deck of cards and a booklet. When the box opens, a Voice will describe the context of the object and why it needs to exist. The deck of cards and booklet are tied to my Project with Carolina called the Interpecies Tarot. It is a tarot deck that illustrates and poses the crucial questions we need to ask ourselves when working with other species to act more in alignment. By using the tarot format, we can go into detail about each concept card in the booklet, while the cards remain evocative images. This works well for the project because we can expand on complex subjects in written form including a mix of scientific concepts, poetic storytelling and references, yet stay engaging and playful. Because the content is not entirely ready yet, the voice recording part of this project (which was Daphne\u2019s idea) is a good addition, since it can be a placeholder until the content is ready (cards+booklet), yet still intrigue and inspire the audience. The inspiration for the booklet is the Dali Tarot Boxset: Step 1: Define how the box will be made. I had orginally thought of laser cutting various pieces of plywood with the lasercutter and assembling them together, however Eduardo suggested I instead CNC the slots shapes into a large block of wood. We went to see the available wood in the scrap pile and found a thick piece of white oak wood that fit the brief perfectly. Step 2: Sketch the file and get feedback.

As you may or may not know, the classroom has no natural light, is very warm, and often has stale feeling air. Spending time in it, we often forget what the (often beautiful) weather is like in Barcelona and the notion of what time of day it is. We have some ideas on how to improve the classroom: - Connecting the inside experience with the outside conditions by displaying the data comparatively - Putting camera and sensors in our patio, or on the beach, or on the street + in our classroom - Live video of the outside sky shown in classs to have a conection to the outside and understand real time, weather, temperature, and actually see daylight - Changing the lighting to not be florescent - Adding plants - Adding materials that absorb sound and/or air toxins - Having ergonomic furniture for posture & concentration - Creating space to display materials and projects to enhance creativity, inspiration, and tidyness But to make the case to enhance the classroom, we need to collect data to show that the current environment is not conducive to learning. So we decided to monitor the MDEF classroom and another IAAC classroom weather conditions, noise, air quality, and light. We hope to compare these two to see which has better learning conditions. Additionally, we would like to compare them with outside weather. Research \u00b6 Well-designed classrooms make a significant difference to academic performance where studies have found that improved physical characteristics can boost the learning abilities of students. In a study from University of Salford, UK, the findings reveal that certain design elements are intrinsic to improving learning in the classroom. These are: Daylight, Indoor air quality, Acoustic environment, Temperature, Classroom design and Stimulation (commercial.velux.com, n.d.). Air Quality The quality of indoor air inside offices, schools, and other workplaces is important not only for workers\u2019 comfort but also for their health. Poor indoor air quality (IAQ) has been tied to symptoms like headaches, fatigue, trouble concentrating, and irritation of the eyes, nose, throat and lungs impacting health and learning outcomes ( www.osha.gov , n.d.). Classroommicroclimate is the first key factor determining a healthy or unhealthy school environment, and it is influenced by ventilation, temperature and humidity rate. Classrooms are usually crowded, overheated and poorly ventilated, thus resulting in possible increases of carbon dioxide (CO2), that can cause several problems when its concentrations exceed the value of 0.15 percentage volume of CO2 (1500 ppm) or even at lower levels (1000 ppm)(Pulimeno et al., 2020). High carbon dioxide levels are an easy-to-measure indicator of overall indoor air quality since high CO2 levels correlate with high levels of dust, mold, mildew and airborne viruses. There is also a correlation between high carbon dioxide levels and reduced attention and test scores (CO2 Meter, n.d.). CO2 can also arise from outside the school, being widely produced by the combustion of fossils or road traffic. Anthropogenic activities are responsible for the emission of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons(PAH) too, which represent other possible external contaminants potentially impairing IAQ. Furtherdangerous exposures for students\u2019 health are those related to natural emission of gas Radon, which typically accumulates in poorly ventilated classrooms, and volatile organic compounds (VOCs, released by building materials, paints, furnishings, detergents), while chemicals substances (i.e.cyanoacrylate, lead, cadmium, nickel) might be contained in school materials (Pulimeno et al., 2020). Natural Light Natural light \u201chelps to regulate our sleep-wake cycles, improves amount and quality of sleep \u2014 which in turn ensures that circulating levels of stress hormone are down, our glucose metabolism is normal and our fatigue levels are controlled. So performance and concentration improves.\u201d Natural light has major paybacks for your energy levels. Several studies have noticed a link between exposure to natural light(especially in home, schools, and office) and steady energy levels during the day. According to the Sacramento Municipal Utility District study, people perform 10-25 percent better on tests of mental function and memory recall when they work in a room with natural light, compared to those with artificial ones. Naturally illuminated work spaces mean even after a busy long day the inhabitant always comes back home with more energy, a greater level of mental and physical clarity. Studies from the Journal of Environmental Psychology, noted a phenomenon that may stem from biophilia \u2014 human beings\u2019 natural desire to be connected with nature. While the concept of biophilia is debatable, the effects of the phenomenon are not; researchers noted that simply staring at an image of natural scenery for 40 seconds was enough to trigger the brain into a more relaxed state. The control group in this study stared at a concrete roof, while the test subjects stared at a green meadow. Beyond this feeling of relaxation, subjects who stared at the green meadow performed significantly better in a test of attention after the initial session; they made fewer mistakes, and were less distracted all around (Johansson, 2018). Over-illuminating spaces with artificial lighting can have the opposite effect leading to issues like headaches, feelings of discomfort, and anxiety (Lee et al., 2015). Artificial Light Generally, the following interior light levels in schools are recommended: 100 lux for interiors where visual tasks are limited to movement and casual perception, e.g. circulation areas, corridors, etc. 500 lux for interiors where school children need to perform their visual tasks and have a feeling of well-being, e.g. auditoriums, lecture halls, practical rooms and laboratories, libraries (reading areas), etc. In classrooms, this should also be the level of light on the blackboard/whiteboard. For classrooms used by young children, the standard state that the requirement can be lowered to 300 lux by dimming. 750-1000 lux for interiors where visual tasks are difficult, requiring small details to be perceived, or if the assumptions differ from the normal visual conditions (commercial.velux.com, n.d.). Sound. \u201cThe World Health Organization (WHO) recommends 35 decibels as the limit for background noise in school classes. Noise which exceeds this limit makes it more difficult to communicate and to distinguish speec \u201cResearch on the effects of noise show that noise disturbs the learning and wellbeing of children. Noise impairs memory, concentration, the ability to distinguish speech, the process of learning to read and reading comprehension. It has also been discovered that noise is connected to the amount of stress hormones and high blood pressure on children. Research indicates that children do not become accustomed to noise and the harm it causes does not reduce over time\u201d *Particulate Matter: * Particulate matter. A mixture of solid and liquid particles in the air that are small enough not to settle out on to the Earth\u2019s surface under the influence of gravity, classified by aerodynamic diameter. Air pollutants measured include PM2.5 and PM10 (particles with an aerodynamic diameter of equal or less than 2.5, also called fine, and 10 micrometre respectively), ozone (O3), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), carbon monoxide (CO) and sulfur dioxide (SO2). Fine particulate matter (PM2.5) can penetrate through the lungs and further enter the body through the blood stream, affecting all major organs. Exposure to PM2.5 can cause diseases both to our cardiovascular and respiratory system, provoking, for example stroke, lung cancer and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

It allows people to easily measure and collect data such as air quality and noise levels from their environment, and visualize it while sharing it with everyone on its dedicated platform. All of these, while being completely open-source and customizable to your needs. It measures Weather Conditions, Noise Levels, Air Quality and Light Levels which makes it a good option to measure and collect data from the interior qualities of the MDEF classroom. The kit includes sensors for air temperature, relative humidity, noise level, ambient light, barometric pressure, equivalent carbon dioxide, volatile organic compounds and particle matter.

Then we connected all to the ORANGE data platform and started comparing the parameters between them. The 3 points data was merged and converted to charts, so we could compare the parameters that are important for sensing the ambient quality of the rooms, those were: Light Noise CO2 Temperature TVOC PM 1.0 PM 2.5 eCO2 Humidity References: TVOC: Total volatile organic compounds is a grouping of a wide range of organic chemical compounds to simplify reporting when these are present in ambient air or emissions. Many substances, such as natural gas, could be classified as volatile organic compounds (VOCs). PM: Stands for particulate matter: the term for a mixture of solid particles and liquid droplets found in the air. Some particles, such as dust, dirt, soot, or smoke, are large or dark enough to be seen with the naked eye. eCO2: Equivalent CO2 is the concentration of CO2 that would cause the same level of radiative forcing as a given type and concentration of greenhouse gas. Examples of such greenhouse gases are methane, perfluorocarbons, and nitrous oxide.

Artificial Light Generally, the following interior light levels in schools are recommended: 100 lux for interiors where visual tasks are limited to movement and casual perception, e.g. circulation areas, corridors, etc. 500 lux for interiors where school children need to perform their visual tasks and have a feeling of well-being, e.g. auditoriums, lecture halls, practical rooms and laboratories, libraries (reading areas), etc. In classrooms, this should also be the level of light on the blackboard/whiteboard. For classrooms used by young children, the standard state that the requirement can be lowered to 300 lux by dimming. 750-1000 lux for interiors where visual tasks are difficult, requiring small details to be perceived, or if the assumptions differ from the normal visual conditions (commercial.velux.com, n.d.). Sound. \u201cThe World Health Organization (WHO) recommends 35 decibels as the limit for background noise in school classes. Noise which exceeds this limit makes it more difficult to communicate and to distinguish speec \u201cResearch on the effects of noise show that noise disturbs the learning and wellbeing of children. Noise impairs memory, concentration, the ability to distinguish speech, the process of learning to read and reading comprehension. It has also been discovered that noise is connected to the amount of stress hormones and high blood pressure on children. Research indicates that children do not become accustomed to noise and the harm it causes does not reduce over time\u201d *Particulate Matter: * Particulate matter. A mixture of solid and liquid particles in the air that are small enough not to settle out on to the Earth\u2019s surface under the influence of gravity, classified by aerodynamic diameter. Air pollutants measured include PM2.5 and PM10 (particles with an aerodynamic diameter of equal or less than 2.5, also called fine, and 10 micrometre respectively), ozone (O3), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), carbon monoxide (CO) and sulfur dioxide (SO2). Fine particulate matter (PM2.5) can penetrate through the lungs and further enter the body through the blood stream, affecting all major organs. Exposure to PM2.5 can cause diseases both to our cardiovascular and respiratory system, provoking, for example stroke, lung cancer and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).","title":"Research"},{"location":"fablab/10-measuringtheworld/#project-goals","text":"leading inquiry in a question How does the built environment affect our health and learning? objective in a sentence To create a better environment for learning and wellbeing in (our) MDEF classrooom but proving the current class conditions are sub-optimal. question(s) in a sentence Is the air and light quality in the MDEF classroom conducive to optimal health and learning conditions? hypothesis in a sentence The MDEF classroom has poor ventilation, air quality, natural light levels, and noise quality. null hypothesis in a sentence The MDEF classroom environment is optimal for learning. reasoning in a sentence the MDEF classroom is a non-concentration friendly environment.","title":"Project Goals"},{"location":"fablab/10-measuringtheworld/#tips","text":"If we were to attempt this again we would: - Measure the environment over a longer period of time - Speak to our fellow peers and collect data from them about how the class makes them feel - Have more energy to tackle this","title":"Tips"},{"location":"fablab/10-measuringtheworld/#from-hypothesis-to-data","text":"","title":"From hypothesis to data"},{"location":"fablab/10-measuringtheworld/#tool-selected","text":"S M A R T C I T I Z E N K I T We decided to work with a Smart Citizen Kit.

Nuria Conde Pueyo and Jordi Plat taught us the Biology part, each day unloading new swaths of knowledge. Some information was entirely new to me and had to do with to complex systems and the interaction between the scales of life. Jonathan Minchin then intervened on the Agriculture section, sharing his journey with projects ROMI and OpenSource BeeHives. He emphasized the necessity of working with life - practically before conceptually. I was particularly struck by the concept of Measure Transitions explained on the first day: The first measure transition is the appearance of Something from Nothing. The second measure transition is the appearance of unicellular life.The interaction of macromolecules leads to the third measure transition: Multicellular life. Some people consider a fourth measure transition which includes the appearance of organisms whose multicellular systems interact in complex systems: eg animals. Because of the interaction between bodies (complex multi-multicellular organisms), we can have a Cultural Evolution. And because of this, we are now able to change things. We are not a passive subjects of evolution we are an active participant. Cue Synthetic Biology So what will be the next measure transition? The course allowed us to learn about DIY Biology and biolabs, Nuria having founded the one in Barcelona. She shared with us the basic equipment of a biolab and to each one, its hacked version. To me, that was very exciting: The fact that complex equipment can be reproduced on the cheap. the fact that biotech equipment becomes more and more affordable, and that many people are working on offering accessible versions, for science eduction and beyond. And the fact that designers can use these to start experimenting at home or DIY Labs. Voir cette publication sur Instagram Une publication partag\u00e9e par Paige Perillat (@paigeperill) Assignment: Choose a journalistic article relating to biology or agriculture and comment on it + tie it to existing scientific articles I chose an essay from Aeon, an online publication with a philosophical focus. Its title: \u00abMutual entrapment: As Neolithic people transformed prehistoric forests, they stumbled into an ecological trap. Domestication goes both ways\u00bb The article is beautiful, well written. It starts with a portrait of Neolithic times, describing the scene of a forest clearing by Neolithic peoples and how that action allows for Heather to proliferate freely: the fire activating its seeds for the next spring. The author: Mette L\u00f8vschal , goes on to describe how this scene, while it may be seen as the domestication of a landscape, could also be thought of as the beginning of a long period of mutual entrapment.\u2028\u2028 \u00ab Among the first forest clearings, we see early humans engaging in a new form of worldmaking, unaware that in some distant future this changed landscape would lock its domesticators into trajectories of care and maintenance from which it will become almost impossible to escape \u00bb . Indeed, when we look at the literature, we find several papers that studied heather and its \u00ab fire response \u00bb. Some varieties of heather almost demand to be burned for their seeds to spread properly, while others don\u2019t. The varieties that have a fire response correlate to deep time patterns in human activity [Vandvik, Vigdis & T\u00f6pper, Joachim & Cook, Zo\u00eb & Daws, Matthew & Heegaard, Einar & M\u00e5ren, Inger & Velle, Liv. (2014). Management-driven evolution in a domesticated ecosystem. Biology Letters. 10. 10.1098/rsbl.2014.0156. ] proving a history of coevolution, and arguably, mutual domestication. \u00ab The heathlands of the Holocene were anthropogenic. The sunlight and fire were not gifts of a changing climate. They were bestowed by Neolithic agro-pastoralists who began felling and burning the understory to make forest clearings. [\u2026] It couldn\u2019t be left alone. Heather now depended on the focused attention of people, on frequent grazing by the animals of pastoralists, and on fire to prevent its botanical competitors, such as birch and crowberry, from taking over the new sun-lit clearings. \u00bb . The article reminded me of the concept of the Anthropocene, and the debate over when it can be deemed to have started. Was it back then? Nuria gave a definition in class that was interesting, she felt it meant that \u00ab we have changed the environment enough that we are active agents of evolution. We force other living organisms on earth to survive or die in our landscape forming\u00bb. This article argues that Anthropocene or not, the changes we make on our landscape lock us in patterns of mutual dependency, and suggests that we are not fully conscious agents of the changes we make. In other words, our inability to think in deep time has locked us a myriad of systems of domestication that may not serve us.

Nuria Conde Pueyo and Jordi Plat taught us the Biology part, each day unloading new swaths of knowledge. Some information was entirely new to me and had to do with to complex systems and the interaction between the scales of life. Jonathan Minchin then intervened on the Agriculture section, sharing his journey with projects ROMI and OpenSource BeeHives. He emphasized the necessity of working with life - practically before conceptually. I was particularly struck by the concept of Measure Transitions explained on the first day: The first measure transition is the appearance of Something from Nothing. The second measure transition is the appearance of unicellular life.The interaction of macromolecules leads to the third measure transition: Multicellular life. Some people consider a fourth measure transition which includes the appearance of organisms whose multicellular systems interact in complex systems: eg animals. Because of the interaction between bodies (complex multi-multicellular organisms), we can have a Cultural Evolution. And because of this, we are now able to change things. We are not a passive subjects of evolution we are an active participant. Cue Synthetic Biology So what will be the next measure transition? The course allowed us to learn about DIY Biology and biolabs, Nuria having founded the one in Barcelona. She shared with us the basic equipment of a biolab and to each one, its hacked version. To me, that was very exciting: The fact that complex equipment can be reproduced on the cheap. the fact that biotech equipment becomes more and more affordable, and that many people are working on offering accessible versions, for science eduction and beyond. And the fact that designers can use these to start experimenting at home or DIY Labs.

Its title: \u00abMutual entrapment: As Neolithic people transformed prehistoric forests, they stumbled into an ecological trap. Domestication goes both ways\u00bb The article is beautiful, well written. It starts with a portrait of Neolithic times, describing the scene of a forest clearing by Neolithic peoples and how that action allows for Heather to proliferate freely: the fire activating its seeds for the next spring. The author: Mette L\u00f8vschal , goes on to describe how this scene, while it may be seen as the domestication of a landscape, could also be thought of as the beginning of a long period of mutual entrapment.\u2028\u2028 \u00ab Among the first forest clearings, we see early humans engaging in a new form of worldmaking, unaware that in some distant future this changed landscape would lock its domesticators into trajectories of care and maintenance from which it will become almost impossible to escape \u00bb . Indeed, when we look at the literature, we find several papers that studied heather and its \u00ab fire response \u00bb. Some varieties of heather almost demand to be burned for their seeds to spread properly, while others don\u2019t. The varieties that have a fire response correlate to deep time patterns in human activity [Vandvik, Vigdis & T\u00f6pper, Joachim & Cook, Zo\u00eb & Daws, Matthew & Heegaard, Einar & M\u00e5ren, Inger & Velle, Liv. (2014). Management-driven evolution in a domesticated ecosystem. Biology Letters. 10. 10.1098/rsbl.2014.0156. ] proving a history of coevolution, and arguably, mutual domestication. \u00ab The heathlands of the Holocene were anthropogenic. The sunlight and fire were not gifts of a changing climate. They were bestowed by Neolithic agro-pastoralists who began felling and burning the understory to make forest clearings. [\u2026] It couldn\u2019t be left alone. Heather now depended on the focused attention of people, on frequent grazing by the animals of pastoralists, and on fire to prevent its botanical competitors, such as birch and crowberry, from taking over the new sun-lit clearings. \u00bb . The article reminded me of the concept of the Anthropocene, and the debate over when it can be deemed to have started. Was it back then? Nuria gave a definition in class that was interesting, she felt it meant that \u00ab we have changed the environment enough that we are active agents of evolution. We force other living organisms on earth to survive or die in our landscape forming\u00bb. This article argues that Anthropocene or not, the changes we make on our landscape lock us in patterns of mutual dependency, and suggests that we are not fully conscious agents of the changes we make. In other words, our inability to think in deep time has locked us a myriad of systems of domestication that may not serve us. These patterns are ongoing, and in creation: \u00ab We have become entrapped in an unethical, unsustainable and damaging high-fertility production apparatus, with its own logic of expansion. Even the infrastructures that make agricultural production possible involve an ever-expanding formation of consultants, subsidy schemes, education, science, materials and technologies. But domestication never gives free gifts. The costs are high \u2013 and inflective. They turn back on us \u00bb .\u2028\u2028 L\u00f8vschal\u2019s view is not optimistic. And the story he tells is important. As we move into territories of genetic engineering, it becomes even more imperative to understand how human interventions on species and landscape change society, and the pattern these changes lock us into.

This is a hugely challenging subject. Communication between humans can be difficult already, and we have barely scratched the surface of what it might mean to communicate with other species. We know how to domesticate and train our pets, we know how to make others species respond to our vocabulary - but entering in a mutual communication exercise has not been a forte of the human species. And when it comes to communicating with the microscopic, it\u2019s even more obscure (and the need is not widely felt) To explore this subject I designed a Microbial Body Scan. I researched the microbial communities at different sites on my body (scalp, palm, gut, feet), and tried to understand their role before diving in. I then performed this meditation, scanning my body and focusing on scalp, palm, gut and feet (for simplicity). I tried to simply observe the sensations in these corporeal spaces, internally vocalizing the names of certain species I knew to be there, and somehow sensing their work in the larger ecosystem of my body. Doing this exercise obviously did not uncover any clear answers. Meditation is in the space of \u201cOther forms of Knowing\u201d and vocalizing any learnings from other states than the rational/intellectual is perhaps a futile thing (though it\u2019s been beautifully explored by poets, writers and musicians - eg The Doors of Perception By Aldous Huxley). But as I focused on the gut space, and the sensations that came up I remembered all the studies that have recently come out. Many scientist are finding the microbial communities in our bodies are crucial to helping us produce the chemicals (the hormones) that we depend on everyday to function. In that way, our emotions and the way we feel - by being an indirect result of the microbial species within us - are a valuable avenue of exploration in terms of interspecies collaboration. And by scanning my body and my microbes and noticing these emotions deeply, I am entering into a conscious relation with my microorganisms. I notice and acknowledge their work. I am a microbial world, I am a Home - Our emotions hugely direct our thought patterns. How positive we feel (serotonin levels) can influence how creative we\u2019ll be on a day, or how many ideas will flow freely. Similarly strong doses of adrenaline (stress) might allow us to find a solution fast. Low levels of these could lock us in unhelpful, repeating patterns of thought. While, these are massive simplifications, the general story is there. By helping produce these chemicals, our microbes influence how we think and hence how we act.

Meaning is what gives our lives a sense of purpose and direction\u2026 to have meaning is to conjure harmony in the natural chaos and imagine a sense of order in our lives. For this we have birthed myriads of fields of thought. Philosophy, religion\u2026 design. All of these practices grapple with the question of meaning, but their approaches differ. In philosophy, meaning is the fundamental concept that concerns the nature of reality, language, and thought. In religion, meaning is often associated with transcendent reality or deity. In design, meaning is about tying our creations to a purpose. Design, especially, is an industry that plays a significant role in crafting the material reality of our daily lives. It shapes the prompts all around us that resonate with meaning, be it aesthetic, functional or capitalist. From the products we use to the environments we inhabit, design influences the human psyche and experience in profound ways. Knowing this, there is a lot to criticise about the design industry. Namely, its superficiality: in a capitalist system that prioritizes mass production, efficiency, and profit it is easy for meaning to be manufactured as well. In fact, environmental historian Jason W. Moore argues that designers need to consider the role of capitalism in shaping our world. Moore suggests that designers need to challenge the dominant economic system and work towards creating a more sustainable and just world. He feels this can be achieved by designing products that are more durable and long-lasting, rather than disposable and short-lived. He argues that by doing so, designers can promote a culture of care and responsibility that is more in alignment with other species and planetary boundaries. So designers have the power to infuse their work with meaning and care. The design process as I have always viewed it should be a process of deep intentionality. But meaning is subjective, and meaning has different layers. As a human I can rationalise my choices. I can make up explanations that are logical, compelling, reasonable. But these rationalisations might be pure invention. And that fact, that superficiality, might be hidden to me if I do not pay attention. The human psyche or is capable of manufacturing meaning in the smallest of things. So what distinguishes the meaning we find to continue daily life - and the profound meaning that shapes a happy life? Kevin Slavin, a designer, and technologist, argues that designers need to take a more active role in shaping the world around them. He suggests that designers need to engage with the systems and structures that govern our lives and question their underlying assumptions. Slavin argues that designers have the power to create products that not only serve a practical purpose but also have a deeper meaning, specifically because they are in connection with others. And that his can be achieved by designing products that are more sustainable, ethical, and socially responsible. So designers are accountable for shaping the world. From the products we use to the environments we inhabit. However, for too long, designers have focused solely on human-centric design, ignoring the role of non-human actants in our lives. Trends in design have taken many names. And from Bauhaus to Nordic-chic, they have failed to encompass the wider ecosystems we are part of. They have manufactured layers and layers of meaning but they have failed to truly connect with our ecologies. Non-human actants are entities that have agency and influence in the world, such as animals, plants, and technologies. And it\u2019s clear that to create truly sustainable and equitable design, designers must integrate non-human actants into their practice. For designers to shift their focus from a human-centric worldview to an ecocentric one, a designer must acknowledge the interconnectedness of all living beings and the importance of the natural world in shaping them. Meaning in design is hence not just tied to connection with the wider world but to the history and future of all these things together. Meaning \u2014 is intricately linked to time, and a deep intention around it: designers must consider the impact of their designs on the environment and the non-human actants that inhabit it in the past, present and future. For example, when designing a building, one needs to consider the impact of the building on the local ecosystem. They need to consider how the building will affect humans as well as the flora and fauna in the area and how it will impact the local water supply, as much as how it respects a place\u2019s history and the impact of the building on the ecosystem\u2019s future. It is a challenging dance of factors to design for, yet it is the only profound course of action. Raj Patel, an academic and writer, argues in favour of this. He feels that design needs to be reimagined in the context of a more sustainable and just world. He suggests that designers need to think beyond aesthetics and functionality and consider the broader social and environmental impact of their work. Patel argues that designers need to work in collaboration with other disciplines, such as ecology and sociology, to create products that are in harmony with the natural world and promote social justice. In a way, we find meaning when meaning is reflected back to us. When the impact of our actions reverberates positively in our timeline. Also in a way, the current climate emergency presents a unique opportunity for designers to be filled with meaning. For centuries, humans have been focused on the pursuit of material wealth and the accumulation of resources, often at the expense of the natural world. However, as the effects of climate change become increasingly evident, a new set of challenges and ways of existing in the world have been presented to us. The climate emergency is forcing us to confront some fundamental questions about our relationship with the natural world (and our place in the universe!). We are being forced to re-examine our values and priorities and to reconsider what it means to live a meaningful life. In doing so, we are being given an opportunity to redefine ourselves as a species and to create a new sense of purpose and direction. One of the ways in which the climate emergency is forcing us to find meaning is by challenging us to think about the legacy we will leave behind for future generations. We are being forced to consider the long-term consequences of our actions and to take responsibility for the impact that we are having on the planet. This is causing us to re-evaluate our relationship with the natural world\u2026 to consider the ethical implications of our behavior. By highlighting the interconnectedness of all things, the events of the last decades be it pandemics or natural disasters, are forcing us to recognize that our actions have a direct impact on the health and well-being of other species and the planet as a whole. This is causing us to re-evaluate our sense of self and our relationship with the world around us. We are being challenged to embrace a more holistic and interconnected worldview that recognizes the inherent value of all life. Furthermore, the climate emergency is also providing us with an opportunity to rediscover a sense of community and togetherness. As we confront the challenges of climate change, we are being forced to work together in new and innovative ways. We are being forced to collaborate across national boundaries and to come together as a global community to address this existential threat. In doing so, we are rediscovering the importance of empathy, compassion, and solidarity. Essential ingredients for a meaningful life. For Gregory Bateson, a philosopher and anthropologist, meaning is not something that can be found in the object or experience itself but is rather a product of the relationship between the individual and the environment. Bateson suggests that designers need to consider the relationship between the user and the product and design products that promote a meaningful relationship. This can be achieved by designing products that are more interactive and engaging, that encourage the user to form a deeper connection with the product. Today this connection has to take the form of a question \u201cis this object or experience respectful of the wider ecological reality I belong to?\u201d Designers must now think more holistically about the design process, considering the full lifecycle of a product and the impact it will have on the environment. This requires designers to integrate non-human actants into their practice, taking into account the materials used, the energy consumed, and the waste generated. By doing so, designers can help to create products that are not only functional and aesthetically pleasing but also sustainable and ecologically meaningful. One of the key challenges facing designers in 2023 is the need to create products that are less reliant on non-renewable resources or extractive in nature. This requires designers to look beyond traditional materials such as plastic and metal and explore alternative materials that are more sustainable and environmentally friendly. For example, designers may look to natural materials such as wood, bamboo, and cork, which are renewable and biodegradable and growable with low impact. In conclusion, the utility of a designer in 2023 is not just to create aesthetically pleasing designs, but also to integrate non-human actants into everyday design as a response to the ecological emergency we find ourselves in. By considering the full lifecycle of a product and the impact it will have on the environment, designers can help to create products that are not only functional and aesthetically pleasing but also sustainable and environmentally responsible. This requires designers to look beyond traditional materials and ways of doing and explore alternative materials that are more sustainable, to explore new technologies that are more energy-efficient, and to think more broadly about the ecological impact of their creations. By doing so, designers can help to create a more sustainable and resilient world that is better equipped to deal with the challenges of the 21 st century.

Learning Skills: Which skills did I need during the activity and how can I translate into something useful for me and my future? The reflection tree was interesting as an exercise to do at the beginning stage of the project. I needed to draw on my past experiences in other projects to imagine what might happen in the one I chose to apply to Rflection Tree to (the Interspecies Tarot) Dynamics: How was the dynamic inside the group? We helped each other answer questions on our respective project and challenged some of the content in the reflection tree. Interactions: Did the role I played influence my opinion? As a user, and as someone who has gone through many workshops such as this one, it was interesting to critique the flow and content of the activity. Learning Skills: Which skills did I need during the activity and how can I translate into something useful for me and my future? This one was about playful debate and lateral thinking. Using other methods of brainstorming (coffee painting) to draw out insights about the meaning of curiosity. Dynamics: How was the dynamic inside the group? Playful, engaged, ready to debate and challenge each other as well as be vulnerable; Interactions: Did the role I played influence my opinion? I had put out the \u201cCuriosity\u201d value, but my classmates exitedly took it to heart and gave their opinions. I learned a lot from them.","title":"April 11th to 14th 2023 : Distributed Design"},{"location":"term3/02-prototypingfordesign/","text":"April 19 th & 20 th 2023 : Prototyping for Design \u00b6 Reflection These classes were focused on Robotic Arms and Blender. While I could not attend the robotic arm class I caught up with the help of my classmates. It is fascinating how pervasive robots are in our lives, and even more so at IAAC. It was interesting to think about the basic functioning of a robotic arm and how many axes (6) it has to function. This means a tremendous amount of precision and possibility of movement, and the opportunity to create complex assembly lines that build anything from our assembly lines to our yoghurts. The Blender class was interesting. While I still have not managed to find deep interest in CAM or truly develop my skills in this area, Victor is a great and passionate teacher and openined our eyes to the Blender ecosystem as well as its values. It is crazy to me how profoundly a tool can be developed with the impetus of a few passionate people and a supportive community. We did try and follow Victor to execute a few operations on Blender, though many of us struggled due to various software issues. Some of my classmate did manage to operate the led strip. The last class of this seminar involved live coding. This was also fasccinating to me, because although I don\u2019t connect to this practice, I could see the existence of a whole community of practice, gathering common excercices and sharing skills purely for art\u2019s sake. In the classes we learned that coders sometimes invent their own languages and interfaces as is the case with Hydra. it was fun to experiment with the software and be guided through it, though this is not my world and I likely won\u2019t interact with this much further.","title":"Prototyping for Design"},{"location":"term3/02-prototypingfordesign/#april-19th-20th-2023-prototyping-for-design","text":"Reflection These classes were focused on Robotic Arms and Blender.
