As we go about our daily lives, most of the information we capture about the future shows disastrous fact; it shapes a storytelling that is ultimately crippling us. By emerging an optimistic balance point in our future, this narrative hopes to define a human/non-human equilibrium to aspire to. I use storytelling to shape my work {my fight} so as to create an embodied idea of the nebulous instincts that pull me; but also to communicate outwards and invite others on an adventure straddling the practical and speculative. The imagery included in the poster shows famous biodesign projects and tools, from Neri Oxman\u2019s Aguahoja to more obscure Star Trek references (the Bio-ship from Species 8472: literally an extension of the extraterrestrials\u2019s bodies), all mythic experiments in storytelling, that I aspire to. Personal Development Plan As I develop Electric Skin, I am learning what it takes to go develop a biodesign project. I am embodying my future user/customer. I am able to explore what challenges exist for artists and designers, how to connect to the scary world of biotech and labs, how to gain funding but also how to collaborate in interdisciplinarity. In my microprojects in MDEF I will be doing the same. Embodying. All of the hoops I have to jump through will help me be a better facilitator when I create this future Space. I will also be observing the skills of my teachers/professors. To support these goals I also need to develop foundational knowledge in Design, Biology, and Digital Fabrication etc to be able to interface better with the community that exists in this world. I am hoping to build connections in the region to establish my residency, as well as understand and deepen my understanding of what it takes to create a space for learning and enabling learning but also deliver impactful research. IAAC is also an inspiration on how to create an internationally renowned hub for cutting edge knowledge and I hope to learn from that set of skills.

Because my plans for the future include creating a biodesign residency in a rural area, I chose the cards that corresponded to this goal: Interspecies Collaboration and Rural Futures. If I have to distill them, these weak signals are the two forces I feel will drive the future I hope to live in. Rural Futures are crucial because this archetypal territory is the interface between the city and the wild. It is the liminal space where research into new ways of making can more adequately be explored because it is more exposed to the non-human. The City is too alienated, the Wild should be left alone. Rurality is the frontier of futures exploration, and it should do so through Interspecies Collaboration. It is well known we are ushering a new massive extinction. We do not know well how to relate with the non-human. From the antibiotic resistance crisis to unhealthy breeding practices and industrial farming systems, we have pushed the limits of the unethical. As we develop our understanding of synthetic biology, it is crucial we establish new frameworks and vocabularies for Human/ Non-Human relating. And while bioethics have been explored in the past, we need explore this beyond academic methods, creating toolkits for a wider public of makers, designers, and researchers. O Ancestral Futures, Digital Fabrication, Material Development, Cognitive diversity etc are all cards that come in complement to the two main themes. They are the areas of research that can come out of a rural biodesign residency Questions I want to explore this year that are reflected on the board are: How do our homes welcome non-human others? How does the Rural push the edges of innovation ? How does what we learn in the rural space affect the urban space? How do we work ethically with other species?
