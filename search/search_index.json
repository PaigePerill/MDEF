Prototyping is a way to generate knowledge. It allows for the combining of expertise from various backgrounds. In that sense, the way we prototype shapes our project. We can divide prototyping into 4 roles. In this section I am exploring how I have used prototyping in my projects, especially my ongoing project Electric Skin . Role 1 - The Prototype as an Experimental Component Role 1 is about testing specific hypotheses. The prototype embeds the theory we\u2019re trying to test. *Case Study 1 I am working on a project called Electric Skin: A new biomaterial that can generate electricity fromm the humidity in the air - and to demonstrate it we\u2019re attempting to create a Wall Light. I used Role 1 to test my colleague Nada \u2019s renders for an our Wall Light prototype in various materials. Our hypotheses was that Chitin would be a good base material for the skin and that our lamp could be built using a clay 3D printer. What did I learn? I had never used 3D printing technologies. I worked with Guillaume Barbareau , a 3D printing expert at his residency space at the Printemps de Septembre and witnessed first hand the complexities of biomaterial 3D printing. I first worked on the chitin paste and assembled the recipe with the help of chef Anton Petrov . This was a challenge. There are a few chitin biomaterial recipes, and even some open research on chitin pastes for 3D printing. However making the paste is not straightforward. The chitin reacts with the calcium and makes it very hard to mix. In the absence of an appropriate blender we had to hand mix, which could only be done with strong arms (not mine). We then tested this paste in the 3D printer (EAZAO make). Our Chitin material\u2019s texture was very sticky so it was hard to insert into the tube and then figuring out the right extrusion speed and pressure were also challenges, well handled by Guillaume. The Chitin tests were inconclusive - the drying process revealed shrinkage problems but the biggest lesson was that perhaps in the Electric Skin project, that was not where we wanted to innovate. Hence we tested Nada\u2019s render with clay (which was what the 3D printer was made for) which gave better results, but still showed us that the intricacies of the design (the wavy surface texture) was difficult to 3D print in the sense that we could not get the extrusion speed right and layers or clay would be peeled off.

There I did extensive reading, catching up on basic biology concepts, biodesign theory and building microbial literacy. One seminal work I read was \u201cMicrobes and other Shamanic being\u201d by Cesar Giraldo Herrera. In this book, which is his phd thesis, he compares anthropological accounts of shamanistic spirits and our current understanding of microbiology. He makes intriguing parallels, and theorises that perhaps, some of these \u201cspirits\u201d (in quotes because he extensively critiques this word) are in fact microbes, and that some shamans are entering in a human/non-human dialogue through the use of altered states (extensive fasting, psychedelics etc). As we work with Electric Skin, and enter ourselves in a collaboration with *Geobacter sulfurresducens , I have been questioning how we can understand what this species \u201cneeds\u201d and how to work ethically with it. I wonder how to even answer that question when we are so far removed (this bacteria is one of the oldest on earth). How does a Human step into its perspective and remove as much bias as possible. Explore Other Modes of Knowing. I decided to test Cesar\u2019s Theory myself; Can we used altered states as a way to communicate with microbes, and specifically our own microbial communities? Can we use altered states to explore knowledge beyond our rational thinking brain? I decided to use psychedelics and try to enter into a dialogue with my own microbial ecosystems. in the evening I took a synthetic version of mescaline (close to a so called heroic dose) and consciously invited my body to surrender to the substance. As the night progressed I went up to the rooftop overlooking the desert and stood upright, soles rooted into the ground and hands turned upwards. By adopting this posture, I was attempting to make myself a satellite to within and voiced \u201cI am here, I am listening\u201d. Immediately in this altered state, my entire body entered in state of paresthesia. A response from my microbial community? While it is impossible know where the lines of reality were, this experience can be seen as a way of using process to inquire about other modes of knowing to relate to the non-human. Role 2 - The Prototype as a means of Inquiry This involves prototyping to explore something that you don\u2019t know yet. To uncover a theory rather than compare hypotheses. I attended the Future of Life 2022 program in Karlsruhe and participated in the Human-Non-Human workshop track organized and taught by Paula Nerlich and Romy Kaiser of the HBBE and Human Bacteria Interfaces. There we explored working with Non-Humans, with a special focus on microbes (with Electric Skin, I am working with Geobacter sulfurresducens , and I\u2019m interested in deepening my knowledge of this species, and learn how to work well/ethically with it. I was able to use the facilities at HfG Karlsruhe and 3D print our prototype in a bioresin. I wanted to explore how strangers might react to our Wall Light prototype, especially it shape, its texture, and its meaning given a bit context. At the end of the week, during our presentation, I invited the participants to join me in a \u201critual\u201d. More specifically I invited them to imagine they were waking up and performing a morning routine: walking to the light and contemplating their relationship with the non-human through this symbolic object/subject. I then invited them to come close to the prototype and touch the object. I recorded their reactions and talked to the participants about their feelings engaging in this exercise. Many commented on the \u201cgooeyness\u201d of the object, and the strangeness of it. The exploration revealed our chosen form for the prototype was alien. An effect we were hoping to produce (ie offering an alternative materiality to the objects that surround us) however it also showed us that this is the main message people receive. They feel the strangeness of it but forget the more exciting underlying biodesign principle (electricity from the air + biodegradable object). Role 3 - The prototype as a research archetype This role involves using a prototype to physicalise a specific concept, understanding or space. Here rather than waiting till we can prototype everything, then we simply prototype possibilities. Storytelling can be a way to manifest a research archetype - and Sci Fi is a good example of this. *Case Study Daniel Grushkin and Alexandra Kisielewski, the team behind Biodesigned Magazine invited us to write an article on Electric Skin. Because of the format of this publication which invites deeper personal thinking in relation to Biodesign and its possibilities, we wrote an article that allowed us to reflect on the future we wanted to manifest through this innovation. It was an exercise in speculative storytelling, and through this article we physicalised our concept further. In it, we explored the possibility of our electronic devices to become conscious companions that provide much more than their software. We honed in on the idea that the texture of our phones could hold deep symbolism around our ancestry and in their materiality could become a source of connection and relief rather than blandness. We evolved further renders to illustrate the concept and conjured a meditation to illustrate the future texture of electronic symbionts.

As I am going through the Electric Skin Adventure: the process of building a biodesign project, I am discovering the challenges of navigating the biotech industry. I am confronted to issues in accessing labs or even understanding the species I am working with.

Nuria Conde Pueyo and Jordi Plat taught us the Biology part, each day unloading new swaths of knowledge. Some information was entirely new to me and had to do with to complex systems and the interaction between the scales of life. Jonathan Minchin then intervened on the Agriculture section, sharing his journey with projects ROMI and OpenSource BeeHives. He emphasized the necessity of working with life - practically before conceptually. I was particularly struck by the concept of Measure Transitions explained on the first day: The first measure transition is the appearance of Something from Nothing. The second measure transition is the appearance of unicellular life.The interaction of macromolecules leads to the third measure transition: Multicellular life. Some people consider a fourth measure transition which includes the appearance of organisms whose multicellular systems interact in complex systems: eg animals. Because of the interaction between bodies (complex multi-multicellular organisms), we can have a Cultural Evolution. And because of this, we are now able to change things. We are not a passive subjects of evolution we are an active participant. Cue Synthetic Biology So what will be the next measure transition? The course allowed us to learn about DIY Biology and biolabs, Nuria having founded the one in Barcelona. She shared with us the basic equipment of a biolab and to each one, its hacked version. To me, that was very exciting: The fact that complex equipment can be reproduced on the cheap. the fact that biotech equipment becomes more and more affordable, and that many people are working on offering accessible versions, for science eduction and beyond. And the fact that designers can use these to start experimenting at home or DIY Labs. Voir cette publication sur Instagram Une publication partag\u00e9e par Paige Perillat (@paigeperill) Assignment: Choose a journalistic article relating to biology or agriculture and comment on it + tie it to existing scientific articles I chose an essay from Aeon, an online publication with a philosophical focus. Its title: \u00abMutual entrapment: As Neolithic people transformed prehistoric forests, they stumbled into an ecological trap. Domestication goes both ways\u00bb The article is beautiful, well written. It starts with a portrait of Neolithic times, describing the scene of a forest clearing by Neolithic peoples and how that action allows for Heather to proliferate freely: the fire activating its seeds for the next spring. The author: Mette L\u00f8vschal , goes on to describe how this scene, while it may be seen as the domestication of a landscape, could also be thought of as the beginning of a long period of mutual entrapment.\u2028\u2028 \u00ab Among the first forest clearings, we see early humans engaging in a new form of worldmaking, unaware that in some distant future this changed landscape would lock its domesticators into trajectories of care and maintenance from which it will become almost impossible to escape \u00bb . Indeed, when we look at the literature, we find several papers that studied heather and its \u00ab fire response \u00bb. Some varieties of heather almost demand to be burned for their seeds to spread properly, while others don\u2019t. The varieties that have a fire response correlate to deep time patterns in human activity [Vandvik, Vigdis & T\u00f6pper, Joachim & Cook, Zo\u00eb & Daws, Matthew & Heegaard, Einar & M\u00e5ren, Inger & Velle, Liv. (2014). Management-driven evolution in a domesticated ecosystem. Biology Letters. 10. 10.1098/rsbl.2014.0156. ] proving a history of coevolution, and arguably, mutual domestication. \u00ab The heathlands of the Holocene were anthropogenic. The sunlight and fire were not gifts of a changing climate. They were bestowed by Neolithic agro-pastoralists who began felling and burning the understory to make forest clearings. [\u2026] It couldn\u2019t be left alone. Heather now depended on the focused attention of people, on frequent grazing by the animals of pastoralists, and on fire to prevent its botanical competitors, such as birch and crowberry, from taking over the new sun-lit clearings. \u00bb . The article reminded me of the concept of the Anthropocene, and the debate over when it can be deemed to have started. Was it back then? Nuria gave a definition in class that was interesting, she felt it meant that \u00ab we have changed the environment enough that we are active agents of evolution. We force other living organisms on earth to survive or die in our landscape forming\u00bb. This article argues that Anthropocene or not, the changes we make on our landscape lock us in patterns of mutual dependency, and suggests that we are not fully conscious agents of the changes we make. In other words, our inability to think in deep time has locked us a myriad of systems of domestication that may not serve us. These patterns are ongoing, and in creation: \u00ab We have become entrapped in an unethical, unsustainable and damaging high-fertility production apparatus, with its own logic of expansion.

Nuria Conde Pueyo and Jordi Plat taught us the Biology part, each day unloading new swaths of knowledge. Some information was entirely new to me and had to do with to complex systems and the interaction between the scales of life. Jonathan Minchin then intervened on the Agriculture section, sharing his journey with projects ROMI and OpenSource BeeHives. He emphasized the necessity of working with life - practically before conceptually. I was particularly struck by the concept of Measure Transitions explained on the first day: The first measure transition is the appearance of Something from Nothing. The second measure transition is the appearance of unicellular life.The interaction of macromolecules leads to the third measure transition: Multicellular life. Some people consider a fourth measure transition which includes the appearance of organisms whose multicellular systems interact in complex systems: eg animals. Because of the interaction between bodies (complex multi-multicellular organisms), we can have a Cultural Evolution. And because of this, we are now able to change things. We are not a passive subjects of evolution we are an active participant. Cue Synthetic Biology So what will be the next measure transition? The course allowed us to learn about DIY Biology and biolabs, Nuria having founded the one in Barcelona. She shared with us the basic equipment of a biolab and to each one, its hacked version. To me, that was very exciting: The fact that complex equipment can be reproduced on the cheap. the fact that biotech equipment becomes more and more affordable, and that many people are working on offering accessible versions, for science eduction and beyond. And the fact that designers can use these to start experimenting at home or DIY Labs. Voir cette publication sur Instagram Une publication partag\u00e9e par Paige Perillat (@paigeperill) Assignment: Choose a journalistic article relating to biology or agriculture and comment on it + tie it to existing scientific articles I chose an essay from Aeon, an online publication with a philosophical focus. Its title: \u00abMutual entrapment: As Neolithic people transformed prehistoric forests, they stumbled into an ecological trap. Domestication goes both ways\u00bb The article is beautiful, well written. It starts with a portrait of Neolithic times, describing the scene of a forest clearing by Neolithic peoples and how that action allows for Heather to proliferate freely: the fire activating its seeds for the next spring. The author: Mette L\u00f8vschal , goes on to describe how this scene, while it may be seen as the domestication of a landscape, could also be thought of as the beginning of a long period of mutual entrapment.\u2028\u2028 \u00ab Among the first forest clearings, we see early humans engaging in a new form of worldmaking, unaware that in some distant future this changed landscape would lock its domesticators into trajectories of care and maintenance from which it will become almost impossible to escape \u00bb . Indeed, when we look at the literature, we find several papers that studied heather and its \u00ab fire response \u00bb. Some varieties of heather almost demand to be burned for their seeds to spread properly, while others don\u2019t. The varieties that have a fire response correlate to deep time patterns in human activity [Vandvik, Vigdis & T\u00f6pper, Joachim & Cook, Zo\u00eb & Daws, Matthew & Heegaard, Einar & M\u00e5ren, Inger & Velle, Liv. (2014). Management-driven evolution in a domesticated ecosystem. Biology Letters. 10. 10.1098/rsbl.2014.0156. ] proving a history of coevolution, and arguably, mutual domestication. \u00ab The heathlands of the Holocene were anthropogenic. The sunlight and fire were not gifts of a changing climate. They were bestowed by Neolithic agro-pastoralists who began felling and burning the understory to make forest clearings. [\u2026] It couldn\u2019t be left alone. Heather now depended on the focused attention of people, on frequent grazing by the animals of pastoralists, and on fire to prevent its botanical competitors, such as birch and crowberry, from taking over the new sun-lit clearings. \u00bb . The article reminded me of the concept of the Anthropocene, and the debate over when it can be deemed to have started. Was it back then? Nuria gave a definition in class that was interesting, she felt it meant that \u00ab we have changed the environment enough that we are active agents of evolution. We force other living organisms on earth to survive or die in our landscape forming\u00bb. This article argues that Anthropocene or not, the changes we make on our landscape lock us in patterns of mutual dependency, and suggests that we are not fully conscious agents of the changes we make. In other words, our inability to think in deep time has locked us a myriad of systems of domestication that may not serve us. These patterns are ongoing, and in creation: \u00ab We have become entrapped in an unethical, unsustainable and damaging high-fertility production apparatus, with its own logic of expansion. Even the infrastructures that make agricultural production possible involve an ever-expanding formation of consultants, subsidy schemes, education, science, materials and technologies. But domestication never gives free gifts. The costs are high \u2013 and inflective. They turn back on us \u00bb .\u2028\u2028 L\u00f8vschal\u2019s view is not optimistic. And the story he tells is important. As we move into territories of genetic engineering, it becomes even more imperative to understand how human interventions on species and landscape change society, and the pattern these changes lock us into. But is this even possible? There are limits to the human brain after all.

Assignment:\u2028Take a 24 hour period and embody one an aspect of your design space INSTAGRAM POST TO BE UPLOADED- The Innerspecies Meditation I chose to explore the topic of Interspecies communication. This is a hugely challenging subject. Communication between humans can be difficult already, and we have barely scratched the surface of what it might mean to communicate with other species. We know how to domesticate and train our pets, we know how to make others species respond to our vocabulary - but entering in a mutual communication exercise has not been a forte of the human species. And when it comes to communicating with the microscopic, it\u2019s even more obscure. To explore this subject designed a Microbial Body Scan. I researched the microbial communities at different sites on my body (scalp, palm, gut, feet), and tried to understand their role before diving in. In the 24h I then performed this meditation, scanning my body and focusing on scalp, palm, gut and feet (for simplicity). I tried to simply observe the sensations in these corporeal spaces, internally vocalizing the names of certain species I knew to be there, and somehow sensing their work in the larger ecosystem of my body. Doing this exercise obviously did not uncover any clear answers. Meditation is in the space of \u201cOther forms of Knowing\u201d and vocalizing any learnings from other states than the rational/intellectual is perhaps a futile thing (though it\u2019s been beautifully explored by poets, writers and musicians - eg The Doors of Perception By Aldous Huxley). But as I focused on the gut space, and the sensations that came up I remembered all the studies that have recently come out. Many are finding the microbial communities in our bodies are crucial to helping us produce the chemicals (the hormones) that we depend on everyday to function. In fact in that way, our emotions and the way we feel - by being an indirect result of the microbial species within us - could also be considered a form of communication. And by scanning my body, my microbes and noticing these emotions deeply, I an entering into a conscious relation with \u201cmy\u201d microorganisms. I notice and acknowledge their work. I am a microbial world, I am a Home - Our emotions also hugely direct our thought patterns. How positive we feel (serotonin levels) can influence how creative we\u2019ll be on a day, or how many ideas will flow freely. Similarly strong doses of adrenaline (stress) might allow us to find a solution fast. Low levels of these could lock us in unhelpful, repeating patterns of thought. These are massive simplifications but the general story is there. By helping produce these chemicals, our microbes influence how we think, hence how we act.
