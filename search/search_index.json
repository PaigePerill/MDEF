Prototyping is a way to generate knowledge. It allows for the combining of expertise from various backgrounds. In that sense, the way we prototype shapes our project. We can divide prototyping into 4 roles. In this section I am exploring how I have used prototyping in my projects, especially my ongoing project Electric Skin . Role 1 - The Prototype as an Experimental Component Role 1 is about testing specific hypotheses. The prototype embeds the theory we\u2019re trying to test. *Case Study 1 I am working on a project called Electric Skin: A new biomaterial that can generate electricity fromm the humidity in the air - and to demonstrate it we\u2019re attempting to create a Wall Light. I used Role 1 to test my colleague Nada \u2019s renders for an our Wall Light prototype in various materials. Our hypotheses was that Chitin would be a good base material for the skin and that our lamp could be built using a clay 3D printer. What did I learn? I had never used 3D printing technologies. I worked with Guillaume Barbareau , a 3D printing expert at his residency space at the Printemps de Septembre and witnessed first hand the complexities of biomaterial 3D printing. I first worked on the chitin paste and assembled the recipe with the help of chef Anton Petrov . This was a challenge. There are a few chitin biomaterial recipes, and even some open research on chitin pastes for 3D printing. However making the paste is not straightforward. The chitin reacts with the calcium and makes it very hard to mix. In the absence of an appropriate blender we had to hand mix, which could only be done with strong arms (not mine). We then tested this paste in the 3D printer (EAZAO make). Our Chitin material\u2019s texture was very sticky so it was hard to insert into the tube and then figuring out the right extrusion speed and pressure were also challenges, well handled by Guillaume. The Chitin tests were inconclusive - the drying process revealed shrinkage problems but the biggest lesson was that perhaps in the Electric Skin project, that was not where we wanted to innovate. Hence we tested Nada\u2019s render with clay (which was what the 3D printer was made for) which gave better results, but still showed us that the intricacies of the design (the wavy surface texture) was difficult to 3D print in the sense that we could not get the extrusion speed right and layers or clay would be peeled off. Voir cette publication sur Instagram Une publication partag\u00e9e par Electric Skin (@electric.skin) Role 2 - The Prototype as a means of Inquiry This involves prototyping to explore something that you don\u2019t know yet. To uncover a theory rather than compare hypotheses. I attended the Future of Life 2022 program in Karlsruhe and participated in the Human-Non-Human workshop track organized and taught by Paula Nerlich and Romy Kaiser of the HBBE and Human Bacteria Interfaces. There we explored working with Non-Humans, with a special focus on microbes (with Electric Skin, I am working with Geobacter sulfurresducens , and I\u2019m interested in deepening my knowledge of this species, and learn how to work well/ethically with it. I was able to use the facilities at HfG Karlsruhe and 3D print our prototype in a bioresin. I wanted to explore how strangers might react to our Wall Light prototype, especially it shape, its texture, and its meaning given a bit context. At the end of the week, during our presentation, I invited the participants to join me in a \u201critual\u201d. More specifically I invited them to imagine they were waking up and performing a morning routine: walking to the light and contemplating their relationship with the non-human through this symbolic object/subject. I then invited them to come close to the prototype and touch the object. I recorded their reactions and talked to the participants about their feelings engaging in this exercise. Many commented on the \u201cgooeyness\u201d of the object, and the strangeness of it. The exploration revealed our chosen form for the prototype was alien. An effect we were hoping to produce (ie offering an alternative materiality to the objects that surround us) however it also showed us that this is the main message people receive. They feel the strangeness of it but forget the more exciting underlying biodesign principle (electricity from the air + biodegradable object). Role 3 - The prototype as a research archetype This role involves using a prototype to physicalise a specific concept, understanding or space. Here rather than waiting till we can prototype everything, then we simply prototype possibilities. Storytelling can be a way to manifest a research archetype - and Sci Fi is a good example of this. *Case Study Daniel Grushkin and Alexandra Kisielewski, the team behind Biodesigned Magazine invited us to write an article on Electric Skin. Because of the format of this publication which invites deeper personal thinking in relation to Biodesign and its possibilities, we wrote an article that allowed us to reflect on the future we wanted to manifest through this innovation. It was an exercise in speculative storytelling, and through this article we physicalised our concept further. In it, we explored the possibility of our electronic devices to become conscious companions that provide much more than their software. We honed in on the idea that the texture of our phones could hold deep symbolism around our ancestry and in their materiality could become a source of connection and relief rather than blandness. We evolved further renders to illustrate the concept and conjured a meditation to illustrate the future texture of electronic symbionts.

The prototyping process here can also be a dialogue with yourself and hence be a method of autobiographical inquiry. *Case Study. As I am going through the Electric Skin Adventure: the process of building a biodesign project, I am discovering the challenges of navigating the biotech industry. I am confronted to issues in accessing labs or even understanding the species I am working with. I am uncovering communities and funding vehicles, as well as other interesting practitioners and organizations in the field. Here, the process is crucial.

Adapted from Thesis Draft: Intervention: Altered States/ AUgmented Creativity for non human collaboration For the collective intervention around the question \u201dHow do we use Altered/Augmented states to design from a non-human perspective ?\u201d We had designed a small intervention in the Motion Capture (MOCAP) room at Elisava. A few in the group are interested in water as the non human entity, so we designed a protocol that hopes to decenter the human and bring them more towards a water state of mind. The protocol consisted of several steps: 1: Set the space: we filled the space with a music elaborated by Endel Sounds, they are rhythms created in collaboration between scientists and musicians to provoke various states of mind - from relaxed, to focused or even sleepy. We also flashed a video of jellyfish on a wall (the MOCAP room is not particularly inviting but we wanted to capture the movement of people through space and see if any useful information came up). Flashing a video helped make the space more inviting and evoke a water visual. 2: Drink tea : We hope this action would connect the human to the sound of water being poured, the fluidity of that experience, and the fact that our body is largely made of water. The tea was also made of relaxing herbs, and specifically designed to relax the body and mind for a smoother easing into the experience. It was served in a ritualistic way, in silence, or with prompts to help people be present to the various sensations of the pouring (inspired by tea ceremony rituals). 3: BreathWork + Movement: We invited participants to take deep breaths, relax in to the space, and then get up and move their body in ways that felt right. For many people this is a difficult exercise. We felt it might help people inhabit the space more, and ease the into the next step of the protocol. 4: Moving along a meaning grid: We had mapped 4 corners of the room with different meanings (Human - Non Human and Fluid - Stagnant) and asked participants to freely move around the room grid whilst listening to a poem that evoked water and it different forms and cycles. This is what we hoped to capture with the MOCAP devices. I was the one facilitating this protocol which was intimidating. It was part of the mistakes we made. Though at this stage we had no other option, I am not a trained facilitator and I did not have the deep confidence to lead others into the experience with perfect timings and flow that trained experts might. I moved too quickly through the various steps and as a result the experience felt short, and some participants were less able to \u201cdecenter\u201d. The other crucial mistake we made was not to ask anything of our participants after. the experience. We asked them to write their feelings, but we should have asked them to design with us around a specific question related to water. The grid was also ultimately not successful as it was too intellectual an exercise and kept participants in their mind rather than in their body which instinctually feels like the better space for non-human relating.

I did the CNC Homework as part of my Microchallenge week. Below is the process I followed: InterspeciesTarot \u00b6 Boxset Making Instructions This documentation describes the making of a box for holding a deck of cards and a booklet. When the box opens, a Voice will describe the context of the object and why it needs to exist. The deck of cards and booklet are tied to my Project with Carolina called the Interpecies Tarot. It is a tarot deck that illustrates and poses the crucial questions we need to ask ourselves when working with other species to act more in alignment. By using the tarot format, we can go into detail about each concept card in the booklet, while the cards remain evocative images. This works well for the project because we can expand on complex subjects in written form including a mix of scientific concepts, poetic storytelling and references, yet stay engaging and playful. Because the content is not entirely ready yet, the voice recording part of this project (which was Daphne\u2019s idea) is a good addition, since it can be a placeholder until the content is ready (cards+booklet), yet still intrigue and inspire the audience. The inspiration for the booklet is the Dali Tarot Boxset: Step 1: Define how the box will be made. I had orginally thought of laser cutting various pieces of plywood with the lasercutter and assembling them together, however Eduardo suggested I instead CNC the slots shapes into a large block of wood. We went to see the available wood in the scrap pile and found a thick piece of white oak wood that fit the brief perfectly. Step 2: Sketch the file and get feedback. I sketched heavily on Eduardo\u2019s initial sugggestion drawing including a thin slot for the booklet, a deeper slot for the cards in the middle of the booklet slot and a round slot for the speaker in the top left. Step 3: Model the file. This is not not my skillset, so I asked Ahmed\u2019s help. We used Rhino to create a file. Operations included scaling, extruding and booolean differences. The end result had a different dimensionality that the sketches but made more sense. See file tarotbox.3dm Step 4: Transform the Rhino file into 2D for readability by the CNC Machine. Here Adai helped me to think through the logic of the machine and how to change the settings so the file would succesfully engrave when sent to the machine. Step 5: Cut out a piece of white oak from the larger piece. This we did with the circular saw. It was important to measure right angles properly so we could slot it in the machine well afterwards. Step 6: Eduardo double checked the files and for the last part of the operation which is cutting out the final piece of wood from the larger block, he suggested we use a longer drill bit for the last operation (cuting out the rectangle our of the larger piece of wood) since drilled bits cannot go down more than half their lenght. We then transformed the files to G-Code format and sent them to the printer. Step 7: fix the Oak Piece on the CNC machine in between slots of plywood. Define origin for X Y and Z axes. Step 8 : Launch job. There were 3 seperate jobs. The first one was the back side with the slot for electronics. The second one was the front side with the slots for the booklet, the cars and the microphone. The third one was cutting out the right size out of the larger block - and this is the one we has to change the drill bit. Step 9: Sanding the edges and bridges and then thinking about the aesthetics. I had orginally thought I would create a book cover that woul be covered in bacteria-died silk, but in the end the colors did not match quite right so I decided to keep the box open and focus on the aesthetics of the booklet.","title":"CNC"},{"location":"fablab/09-cnc/#february-march-1st-2023-cnc","text":"Reflection This class covered the topic of CNC (Computerized Numerical Control), which is a highly precise, adaptable and automated method of digital manufacturing suitable for various design purposes.

Because the content is not entirely ready yet, the voice recording part of this project (which was Daphne\u2019s idea) is a good addition, since it can be a placeholder until the content is ready (cards+booklet), yet still intrigue and inspire the audience. The inspiration for the booklet is the Dali Tarot Boxset: Step 1: Define how the box will be made. I had orginally thought of laser cutting various pieces of plywood with the lasercutter and assembling them together, however Eduardo suggested I instead CNC the slots shapes into a large block of wood. We went to see the available wood in the scrap pile and found a thick piece of white oak wood that fit the brief perfectly. Step 2: Sketch the file and get feedback. I sketched heavily on Eduardo\u2019s initial sugggestion drawing including a thin slot for the booklet, a deeper slot for the cards in the middle of the booklet slot and a round slot for the speaker in the top left. Step 3: Model the file. This is not not my skillset, so I asked Ahmed\u2019s help. We used Rhino to create a file. Operations included scaling, extruding and booolean differences. The end result had a different dimensionality that the sketches but made more sense. See file tarotbox.3dm Step 4: Transform the Rhino file into 2D for readability by the CNC Machine. Here Adai helped me to think through the logic of the machine and how to change the settings so the file would succesfully engrave when sent to the machine. Step 5: Cut out a piece of white oak from the larger piece. This we did with the circular saw. It was important to measure right angles properly so we could slot it in the machine well afterwards. Step 6: Eduardo double checked the files and for the last part of the operation which is cutting out the final piece of wood from the larger block, he suggested we use a longer drill bit for the last operation (cuting out the rectangle our of the larger piece of wood) since drilled bits cannot go down more than half their lenght. We then transformed the files to G-Code format and sent them to the printer. Step 7: fix the Oak Piece on the CNC machine in between slots of plywood. Define origin for X Y and Z axes. Step 8 : Launch job. There were 3 seperate jobs. The first one was the back side with the slot for electronics. The second one was the front side with the slots for the booklet, the cars and the microphone. The third one was cutting out the right size out of the larger block - and this is the one we has to change the drill bit. Step 9: Sanding the edges and bridges and then thinking about the aesthetics. I had orginally thought I would create a book cover that woul be covered in bacteria-died silk, but in the end the colors did not match quite right so I decided to keep the box open and focus on the aesthetics of the booklet.","title":"InterspeciesTarot"},{"location":"fablab/10-measuringtheworld/","text":"March \u00b6 Reflection","title":"Measuring the World"},{"location":"fablab/10-measuringtheworld/#march","text":"Reflection","title":"March"},{"location":"fablab/11-microchallenge2/","text":"March \u00b6 Reflection","title":"Microchallenge 2"},{"location":"fablab/11-microchallenge2/#march","text":"Reflection","title":"March"},{"location":"term1/01-Bootcamp/","text":"October 4 th to 7 th 2022 : Bootcamp \u00b6 Poster Assignment: \u201cCreate a Poster that reflects your Fight\u201d Towards Organica is a narrative in development.

This is a hugely challenging subject. Communication between humans can be difficult already, and we have barely scratched the surface of what it might mean to communicate with other species. We know how to domesticate and train our pets, we know how to make others species respond to our vocabulary - but entering in a mutual communication exercise has not been a forte of the human species. And when it comes to communicating with the microscopic, it\u2019s even more obscure (and the need is not widely felt) To explore this subject I designed a Microbial Body Scan. I researched the microbial communities at different sites on my body (scalp, palm, gut, feet), and tried to understand their role before diving in. I then performed this meditation, scanning my body and focusing on scalp, palm, gut and feet (for simplicity). I tried to simply observe the sensations in these corporeal spaces, internally vocalizing the names of certain species I knew to be there, and somehow sensing their work in the larger ecosystem of my body. Doing this exercise obviously did not uncover any clear answers. Meditation is in the space of \u201cOther forms of Knowing\u201d and vocalizing any learnings from other states than the rational/intellectual is perhaps a futile thing (though it\u2019s been beautifully explored by poets, writers and musicians - eg The Doors of Perception By Aldous Huxley). But as I focused on the gut space, and the sensations that came up I remembered all the studies that have recently come out. Many scientist are finding the microbial communities in our bodies are crucial to helping us produce the chemicals (the hormones) that we depend on everyday to function. In that way, our emotions and the way we feel - by being an indirect result of the microbial species within us - are a valuable avenue of exploration in terms of interspecies collaboration. And by scanning my body and my microbes and noticing these emotions deeply, I am entering into a conscious relation with my microorganisms. I notice and acknowledge their work. I am a microbial world, I am a Home - Our emotions hugely direct our thought patterns. How positive we feel (serotonin levels) can influence how creative we\u2019ll be on a day, or how many ideas will flow freely. Similarly strong doses of adrenaline (stress) might allow us to find a solution fast. Low levels of these could lock us in unhelpful, repeating patterns of thought. While, these are massive simplifications, the general story is there. By helping produce these chemicals, our microbes influence how we think and hence how we act.

Meaning is what gives our lives a sense of purpose and direction\u2026 to have meaning is to conjure harmony in the natural chaos and imagine a sense of order in our lives. For this we have birthed myriads of fields of thought. Philosophy, religion\u2026 design. All of these practices grapple with the question of meaning, but their approaches differ. In philosophy, meaning is the fundamental concept that concerns the nature of reality, language, and thought. In religion, meaning is often associated with transcendent reality or deity. In design, meaning is about tying our creations to a purpose. Design, especially, is an industry that plays a significant role in crafting the material reality of our daily lives. It shapes the prompts all around us that resonate with meaning, be it aesthetic, functional or capitalist. From the products we use to the environments we inhabit, design influences the human psyche and experience in profound ways. Knowing this, there is a lot to criticise about the design industry. Namely, its superficiality: in a capitalist system that prioritizes mass production, efficiency, and profit it is easy for meaning to be manufactured as well. In fact, environmental historian Jason W. Moore argues that designers need to consider the role of capitalism in shaping our world. Moore suggests that designers need to challenge the dominant economic system and work towards creating a more sustainable and just world. He feels this can be achieved by designing products that are more durable and long-lasting, rather than disposable and short-lived. He argues that by doing so, designers can promote a culture of care and responsibility that is more in alignment with other species and planetary boundaries. So designers have the power to infuse their work with meaning and care. The design process as I have always viewed it should be a process of deep intentionality. But meaning is subjective, and meaning has different layers. As a human I can rationalise my choices. I can make up explanations that are logical, compelling, reasonable. But these rationalisations might be pure invention. And that fact, that superficiality, might be hidden to me if I do not pay attention. The human psyche or is capable of manufacturing meaning in the smallest of things. So what distinguishes the meaning we find to continue daily life - and the profound meaning that shapes a happy life? Kevin Slavin, a designer, and technologist, argues that designers need to take a more active role in shaping the world around them. He suggests that designers need to engage with the systems and structures that govern our lives and question their underlying assumptions. Slavin argues that designers have the power to create products that not only serve a practical purpose but also have a deeper meaning, specifically because they are in connection with others. And that his can be achieved by designing products that are more sustainable, ethical, and socially responsible. So designers are accountable for shaping the world. From the products we use to the environments we inhabit. However, for too long, designers have focused solely on human-centric design, ignoring the role of non-human actants in our lives. Trends in design have taken many names. And from Bauhaus to Nordic-chic, they have failed to encompass the wider ecosystems we are part of. They have manufactured layers and layers of meaning but they have failed to truly connect with our ecologies. Non-human actants are entities that have agency and influence in the world, such as animals, plants, and technologies. And it\u2019s clear that to create truly sustainable and equitable design, designers must integrate non-human actants into their practice. For designers to shift their focus from a human-centric worldview to an ecocentric one, a designer must acknowledge the interconnectedness of all living beings and the importance of the natural world in shaping them. Meaning in design is hence not just tied to connection with the wider world but to the history and future of all these things together. Meaning \u2014 is intricately linked to time, and a deep intention around it: designers must consider the impact of their designs on the environment and the non-human actants that inhabit it in the past, present and future. For example, when designing a building, one needs to consider the impact of the building on the local ecosystem. They need to consider how the building will affect humans as well as the flora and fauna in the area and how it will impact the local water supply, as much as how it respects a place\u2019s history and the impact of the building on the ecosystem\u2019s future. It is a challenging dance of factors to design for, yet it is the only profound course of action. Raj Patel, an academic and writer, argues in favour of this. He feels that design needs to be reimagined in the context of a more sustainable and just world. He suggests that designers need to think beyond aesthetics and functionality and consider the broader social and environmental impact of their work. Patel argues that designers need to work in collaboration with other disciplines, such as ecology and sociology, to create products that are in harmony with the natural world and promote social justice. In a way, we find meaning when meaning is reflected back to us. When the impact of our actions reverberates positively in our timeline. Also in a way, the current climate emergency presents a unique opportunity for designers to be filled with meaning. For centuries, humans have been focused on the pursuit of material wealth and the accumulation of resources, often at the expense of the natural world. However, as the effects of climate change become increasingly evident, a new set of challenges and ways of existing in the world have been presented to us. The climate emergency is forcing us to confront some fundamental questions about our relationship with the natural world (and our place in the universe!). We are being forced to re-examine our values and priorities and to reconsider what it means to live a meaningful life. In doing so, we are being given an opportunity to redefine ourselves as a species and to create a new sense of purpose and direction. One of the ways in which the climate emergency is forcing us to find meaning is by challenging us to think about the legacy we will leave behind for future generations. We are being forced to consider the long-term consequences of our actions and to take responsibility for the impact that we are having on the planet. This is causing us to re-evaluate our relationship with the natural world\u2026 to consider the ethical implications of our behavior. By highlighting the interconnectedness of all things, the events of the last decades be it pandemics or natural disasters, are forcing us to recognize that our actions have a direct impact on the health and well-being of other species and the planet as a whole. This is causing us to re-evaluate our sense of self and our relationship with the world around us. We are being challenged to embrace a more holistic and interconnected worldview that recognizes the inherent value of all life. Furthermore, the climate emergency is also providing us with an opportunity to rediscover a sense of community and togetherness. As we confront the challenges of climate change, we are being forced to work together in new and innovative ways. We are being forced to collaborate across national boundaries and to come together as a global community to address this existential threat. In doing so, we are rediscovering the importance of empathy, compassion, and solidarity. Essential ingredients for a meaningful life. For Gregory Bateson, a philosopher and anthropologist, meaning is not something that can be found in the object or experience itself but is rather a product of the relationship between the individual and the environment. Bateson suggests that designers need to consider the relationship between the user and the product and design products that promote a meaningful relationship. This can be achieved by designing products that are more interactive and engaging, that encourage the user to form a deeper connection with the product. Today this connection has to take the form of a question \u201cis this object or experience respectful of the wider ecological reality I belong to?\u201d Designers must now think more holistically about the design process, considering the full lifecycle of a product and the impact it will have on the environment. This requires designers to integrate non-human actants into their practice, taking into account the materials used, the energy consumed, and the waste generated. By doing so, designers can help to create products that are not only functional and aesthetically pleasing but also sustainable and ecologically meaningful. One of the key challenges facing designers in 2023 is the need to create products that are less reliant on non-renewable resources or extractive in nature. This requires designers to look beyond traditional materials such as plastic and metal and explore alternative materials that are more sustainable and environmentally friendly. For example, designers may look to natural materials such as wood, bamboo, and cork, which are renewable and biodegradable and growable with low impact. In conclusion, the utility of a designer in 2023 is not just to create aesthetically pleasing designs, but also to integrate non-human actants into everyday design as a response to the ecological emergency we find ourselves in. By considering the full lifecycle of a product and the impact it will have on the environment, designers can help to create products that are not only functional and aesthetically pleasing but also sustainable and environmentally responsible. This requires designers to look beyond traditional materials and ways of doing and explore alternative materials that are more sustainable, to explore new technologies that are more energy-efficient, and to think more broadly about the ecological impact of their creations. By doing so, designers can help to create a more sustainable and resilient world that is better equipped to deal with the challenges of the 21 st century. An exercise in deep meaning.","title":"Making Sense and Meaning"},{"location":"term2/03-makingsenseandmeaning/#january-16th-to-19th-2023-remixing-materials","text":"The concept of meaning is central to human existence. Meaning is what gives our lives a sense of purpose and direction\u2026 to have meaning is to conjure harmony in the natural chaos and imagine a sense of order in our lives. For this we have birthed myriads of fields of thought. Philosophy, religion\u2026 design. All of these practices grapple with the question of meaning, but their approaches differ. In philosophy, meaning is the fundamental concept that concerns the nature of reality, language, and thought. In religion, meaning is often associated with transcendent reality or deity. In design, meaning is about tying our creations to a purpose. Design, especially, is an industry that plays a significant role in crafting the material reality of our daily lives. It shapes the prompts all around us that resonate with meaning, be it aesthetic, functional or capitalist. From the products we use to the environments we inhabit, design influences the human psyche and experience in profound ways. Knowing this, there is a lot to criticise about the design industry. Namely, its superficiality: in a capitalist system that prioritizes mass production, efficiency, and profit it is easy for meaning to be manufactured as well. In fact, environmental historian Jason W. Moore argues that designers need to consider the role of capitalism in shaping our world. Moore suggests that designers need to challenge the dominant economic system and work towards creating a more sustainable and just world. He feels this can be achieved by designing products that are more durable and long-lasting, rather than disposable and short-lived. He argues that by doing so, designers can promote a culture of care and responsibility that is more in alignment with other species and planetary boundaries. So designers have the power to infuse their work with meaning and care. The design process as I have always viewed it should be a process of deep intentionality. But meaning is subjective, and meaning has different layers. As a human I can rationalise my choices. I can make up explanations that are logical, compelling, reasonable. But these rationalisations might be pure invention. And that fact, that superficiality, might be hidden to me if I do not pay attention. The human psyche or is capable of manufacturing meaning in the smallest of things. So what distinguishes the meaning we find to continue daily life - and the profound meaning that shapes a happy life? Kevin Slavin, a designer, and technologist, argues that designers need to take a more active role in shaping the world around them. He suggests that designers need to engage with the systems and structures that govern our lives and question their underlying assumptions. Slavin argues that designers have the power to create products that not only serve a practical purpose but also have a deeper meaning, specifically because they are in connection with others. And that his can be achieved by designing products that are more sustainable, ethical, and socially responsible. So designers are accountable for shaping the world. From the products we use to the environments we inhabit. However, for too long, designers have focused solely on human-centric design, ignoring the role of non-human actants in our lives. Trends in design have taken many names. And from Bauhaus to Nordic-chic, they have failed to encompass the wider ecosystems we are part of. They have manufactured layers and layers of meaning but they have failed to truly connect with our ecologies. Non-human actants are entities that have agency and influence in the world, such as animals, plants, and technologies. And it\u2019s clear that to create truly sustainable and equitable design, designers must integrate non-human actants into their practice. For designers to shift their focus from a human-centric worldview to an ecocentric one, a designer must acknowledge the interconnectedness of all living beings and the importance of the natural world in shaping them. Meaning in design is hence not just tied to connection with the wider world but to the history and future of all these things together. Meaning \u2014 is intricately linked to time, and a deep intention around it: designers must consider the impact of their designs on the environment and the non-human actants that inhabit it in the past, present and future. For example, when designing a building, one needs to consider the impact of the building on the local ecosystem. They need to consider how the building will affect humans as well as the flora and fauna in the area and how it will impact the local water supply, as much as how it respects a place\u2019s history and the impact of the building on the ecosystem\u2019s future. It is a challenging dance of factors to design for, yet it is the only profound course of action. Raj Patel, an academic and writer, argues in favour of this. He feels that design needs to be reimagined in the context of a more sustainable and just world. He suggests that designers need to think beyond aesthetics and functionality and consider the broader social and environmental impact of their work. Patel argues that designers need to work in collaboration with other disciplines, such as ecology and sociology, to create products that are in harmony with the natural world and promote social justice. In a way, we find meaning when meaning is reflected back to us. When the impact of our actions reverberates positively in our timeline. Also in a way, the current climate emergency presents a unique opportunity for designers to be filled with meaning. For centuries, humans have been focused on the pursuit of material wealth and the accumulation of resources, often at the expense of the natural world. However, as the effects of climate change become increasingly evident, a new set of challenges and ways of existing in the world have been presented to us. The climate emergency is forcing us to confront some fundamental questions about our relationship with the natural world (and our place in the universe!). We are being forced to re-examine our values and priorities and to reconsider what it means to live a meaningful life. In doing so, we are being given an opportunity to redefine ourselves as a species and to create a new sense of purpose and direction. One of the ways in which the climate emergency is forcing us to find meaning is by challenging us to think about the legacy we will leave behind for future generations. We are being forced to consider the long-term consequences of our actions and to take responsibility for the impact that we are having on the planet. This is causing us to re-evaluate our relationship with the natural world\u2026 to consider the ethical implications of our behavior. By highlighting the interconnectedness of all things, the events of the last decades be it pandemics or natural disasters, are forcing us to recognize that our actions have a direct impact on the health and well-being of other species and the planet as a whole. This is causing us to re-evaluate our sense of self and our relationship with the world around us. We are being challenged to embrace a more holistic and interconnected worldview that recognizes the inherent value of all life. Furthermore, the climate emergency is also providing us with an opportunity to rediscover a sense of community and togetherness. As we confront the challenges of climate change, we are being forced to work together in new and innovative ways. We are being forced to collaborate across national boundaries and to come together as a global community to address this existential threat. In doing so, we are rediscovering the importance of empathy, compassion, and solidarity. Essential ingredients for a meaningful life.
